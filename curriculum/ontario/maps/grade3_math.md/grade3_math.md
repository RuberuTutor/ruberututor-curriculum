## Strand A: Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) Skills and Mathematical Processes
### Overall Expectation
- Apply SEL skills and mathematical processes (problem solving, reasoning, reflecting, etc.) to support learning and well-being.

| Spec. ID | Skill focus | Worksheet links (vA–vD) | Assessment idea | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | SEL in math learning | `materials/worksheets/math/gr3/sel/A1_vA.md` … `vD.md` | Reflection journals, math talks | Integrated with other strands |

- B2.2: recall and demonstrate multiplication facts for 2, 5, and 10, and related division facts  
- B2.3: solve problems involving addition and subtraction of whole numbers up to 1,000  
- B2.4: multiply one-digit numbers by multiples of 10 (10–90)  
- B2.5: divide whole numbers up to 50, by 2, 5, and 10, using tools and drawings  
- B2.6: represent multiplication of fractions by whole numbers using repeated addition  
- B2.7: represent the relationship between repeated addition of a unit fraction and multiplication of that unit fraction by a whole number  
- B2.8: show simple multiplicative relationships involving whole-number rates (e.g., 3 cookies per child)

## Strand C: Algebra
- C1.1: identify, extend, and create repeating, growing, and shrinking patterns  
- C1.2: represent patterns using tables and graphs  
- C2.1: use the properties of equality and inequalities to solve problems with whole numbers up to 100

- D1.2: interpret bar graphs and pictographs with many-to-one correspondence  
- D2.1: describe probability using terms like “unlikely”, “likely”, “certain”  
- D2.2: perform simple probability experiments and compare results with predictions

## Strand E: Spatial Sense
- E1.1: compare and sort 2D shapes and 3D objects by attributes (sides, faces, vertices)  
- E1.2: compose and decompose 2D shapes and 3D objects  
- E1.3: describe relative positions and movements (translations, reflections, rotations)  
- E2.1: measure length, area, mass, and capacity using standard metric units (mm, cm, m, g, kg, mL, L)  
- E2.2: tell time to the nearest minute and solve problems involving elapsed time  
- E2.3: relate units of time (seconds, minutes, hours, days, months)

## Strand F: Financial Literacy
- F1.1: represent money amounts up to $10, using coins and bills in various combinations  
- F1.2: estimate and calculate change for simple cash transactions involving whole-dollar amounts and amounts less than $1:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Cross-Strand Assessment Task (optional)
**Example**: “School Bake Sale” – students price goods (F1), calculate totals and change (B2, F1.2), track sales in a bar graph (D1), and measure ingredients (E2).
