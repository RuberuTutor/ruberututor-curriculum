## Strand A: Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) Skills and Mathematical Processes
### Overall Expectation
- Apply SEL skills and mathematical processes (problem solving, reasoning, reflecting, representing, connecting, communicating) to support learning and well-being.

| Spec. ID | Skill focus | Worksheet links (vA–vD) | Assessment idea | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | SEL in math contexts | `materials/worksheets/math/gr6/sel/A1_vA.md` … `vD.md` | Math journals, group strategy reflections | Evaluate within strands |

## Cross-Strand Task (optional)
**Example**: *“Plan a School Store”* – students price goods with unit rates (F1.2), calculate total cost and tax (B2, F1.1), design graphs to show sales (D1), measure shelves and storage space (E2), and apply SEL strategies (A1).
