# MDM4U — Mathematics of Data Management

## 1) Strands Overview
- A. Counting and Probability  
- B. Probability Distributions  
- C. Organization of Data for Analysis  
- D. Statistical Analysis  
- E. Culminating Data Management Investigation  

## 2) Overall Expectations

### Strand A — Counting and Probability
By the end of this course, students will:
1. solve problems involving the probability of an event or a combination of events for discrete sample spaces;  
2. solve problems involving the application of permutations and combinations to determine the probability of an event. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### Strand B — Probability Distributions
By the end of this course, students will:
1. demonstrate an understanding of discrete probability distributions, represent them numerically, graphically, and algebraically, determine expected values, and solve related problems from a variety of applications;  
2. demonstrate an understanding of continuous probability distributions, make connections to discrete probability distributions, determine standard deviations, describe key features of the normal distribution, and solve related problems from a variety of applications. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### Strand C — Organization of Data for Analysis
By the end of this course, students will:
1. demonstrate an understanding of the role of data in statistical studies and the variability inherent in data, distinguish different types of data;  
2. describe the characteristics of a good sample, some sampling techniques, and principles of primary data collection, and collect and organize data to solve a problem. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### Strand D — Statistical Analysis
By the end of this course, students will:
1. analyse, interpret, and draw conclusions from one-variable data using numerical and graphical summaries;  
2. analyse, interpret, and draw conclusions from two-variable data using numerical, graphical, and algebraic summaries;  
3. demonstrate an understanding of the applications of data management used by the media and the advertising industry and in various occupations. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### Strand E — Culminating Data Management Investigation
By the end of this course, students will:
1. design and carry out a culminating investigation that requires the integration and application of the knowledge and skills related to the expectations of this course;  
2. communicate the findings of a culminating investigation and provide constructive critiques of the investigations of others. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
