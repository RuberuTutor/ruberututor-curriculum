# MTH1W — Mathematics, Grade 9 (Workplace Preparation)

## 1) Strands Overview
- A. Number Sense and Numeration  
- B. Measurement and Geometry  
- C. Patterning and Algebra  
- D. Data Management and Probability  
- E. Financial Literacy

## 2) Overall Expectations

### Strand A — Number Sense and Numeration
By the end of this course, students will:
- demonstrate an understanding of the magnitude of whole numbers, integers, and decimals through investigation using a variety of tools;  
- solve problems and perform calculations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of whole numbers, integers, and decimals;  
- describe relationships between fractions, decimal, and percent representations using benchmarks.

### Strand B — Measurement and Geometry
By the end of this course, students will:
- estimate, measure, and calculate the perimeter, area, and volume of common two- and three-dimensional figures;  
- describe and represent, through investigation using concrete materials, the relationships among dimensional measures, including similarity and congruence;  
- identify and classify common geometric figures by their properties.

### Strand C — Patterning and Algebra
By the end of this course, students will:
- extend and apply understanding of equality and properties of arithmetic operations to express the relationship between variables in open sentences;  
- solve simple linear equations in one variable, and interpret the solutions;  
- describe and apply patterns, relationships, and rates of change using tables, charts, and graphs.

### Strand D — Data Management and Probability
By the end of this course, students will:
- collect and organize categorical and numerical data, and display the data using charts and graphs for single- and two-variable data;  
- read, describe, and interpret data presented in charts and graphs;  
- conduct a probability experiment using concrete materials, collect and organize the data, and compare the theoretical and experimental probabilities of an event.

### Strand E — Financial Literacy
By the end of this course, students will:
- demonstrate an understanding of financial terms and concepts related to money, spending, and saving;  
- manage a simplified personal budget using income and expense records;  
- calculate the effects of simple interest and discounts in financial situations.
