- D. [name]

## 2) Overall Expectations

### Strand A — Rate of Change
By the end of this course, students will:  
- demonstrate an understanding of rate of change by making connections between average rate of change over an interval and instantaneous rate of change at a point, using the slopes of secants and tangents and the concept of the limit;  
- graph the derivatives of polynomial, sinusoidal, and exponential functions, and make connections between the numeric, graphical, and algebraic representations of a function and its derivative;  
- verify graphically and algebraically the rules for determining derivatives; apply these rules to determine the derivatives of polynomial, sinusoidal, exponential, rational, and radical functions, and simple combinations of functions; and solve related problems.  

### Strand B — Derivatives and Their Applications
By the end of this course, students will:  
- make connections, graphically and algebraically, between the key features of a function and its first and second derivatives, and use the connections in curve sketching;  
- solve problems, including optimization problems, that require the use of the concepts and procedures associated with the derivative, including problems arising from real-world applications and involving the development of mathematical models.  

### Strand C — Geometry and Algebra of Vectors
By the end of this course, students will:  
- demonstrate an understanding of vectors in two-space and three-space by representing them algebraically and geometrically and by recognizing their applications;  
- perform operations on vectors in two-space and three-space, and use the properties of these operations to solve problems, including those arising from real-world applications;  
- distinguish between the geometric representations of a single linear equation or a system of two linear equations in two-space and three-space, and determine different geometric configurations of lines and planes in three-space;  
- represent lines and planes using scalar, vector, and parametric equations, and solve problems involving distances and intersections.
