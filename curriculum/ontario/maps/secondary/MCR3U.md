# Grade 11 Math (MCR3U) — Functions

> **Note:** Use official Ontario curriculum documents only. Paste **verbatim** overall & specific expectations and keep all codes exactly as published.

## 1) Strands Overview
- Strand A: Mathematical Thinking and Making Connections
- Strand B: Number & Algebra
- Strand C: Functions
- Strand D: Financial Applications of Functions

## 2) Overall Expectations (verbatim)

### Strand A — Mathematical Thinking and Making Connections
- **A1**: use mathematical processes to develop reasoning, solve problems, make connections, and communicate ideas across strands and in real-life contexts

### Strand B — Number & Algebra
- **B1**: demonstrate an understanding of the properties of real numbers and algebraic expressions, and apply them in various contexts
- **B2**: use algebraic techniques to simplify expressions, solve equations and inequalities, and model situations

### Strand C — Functions
- **C1**: demonstrate an understanding of the characteristics of functions and their representations, and make connections among them
- **C2**: model and solve problems using a variety of function types (e.g., linear, quadratic, polynomial, exponential), selecting appropriate tools and strategies
- **C3**: analyse and interpret functions in multiple representations (algebraic, graphical, numerical), and communicate reasoning

### Strand D — Financial Applications of Functions
- **D1**: demonstrate an understanding of financial concepts and strategies related to saving, investing, borrowing, and managing money
- **D2**: apply functions and formulas to solve problems involving compound interest, annuities, loans, and other financial contexts

## 3) Specific Expectations (verbatim with codes)
