- **B2**: use algebraic techniques to simplify expressions, solve equations and inequalities, and model situations

### Strand C — Functions
- **C1**: demonstrate an understanding of the characteristics of functions and their representations, and make connections among them
- **C2**: model and solve problems using a variety of function types (e.g., linear, quadratic, polynomial, exponential), selecting appropriate tools and strategies
- **C3**: analyse and interpret functions in multiple representations (algebraic, graphical, numerical), and communicate reasoning

### Strand D — Financial Applications of Functions
- **D1**: demonstrate an understanding of financial concepts and strategies related to saving, investing, borrowing, and managing money
- **D2**: apply functions and formulas to solve problems involving compound interest, annuities, loans, and other financial contexts
