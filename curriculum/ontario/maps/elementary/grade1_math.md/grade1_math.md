## Strand A: Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) Skills and Mathematical Processes
### Overall Expectation
- Apply SEL skills and mathematical processes (problem solving, reasoning, reflecting, representing, connecting, communicating) to support learning and well-being.

| Spec. ID | Skill focus | Worksheet links (vA–vD) | Assessment idea | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | SEL in math learning | `materials/worksheets/math/gr1/sel/A1_vA.md` … `vD.md` | Group problem-solving reflections, math journals | Integrated with all strands |

- B1.5: use place value to represent and describe numbers to 50  
- B1.6: represent fractions (halves, fourths) using concrete materials and drawings  

### B2: Operations
- B2.1: use properties of addition and subtraction to solve problems  
- B2.2: recall addition and subtraction facts within 10, and use to solve problems

- C2.1: use equalities and inequalities to compare whole numbers to 20  
- C2.2: use symbols to represent unknown numbers in simple equations  

---

## Strand D: Data
### D1: Data Literacy
- D1.1: collect and organize categorical data (e.g., favourite fruit, pet ownership)  
- D1.2: display data using concrete graphs and pictographs  
- D1.3: interpret data in simple graphs and answer questions  

### D2: Probability
- D2.1: describe likelihood of events using terms “impossible”, “possible”, “certain”  
- D2.2: make and test predictions about chance events with familiar contexts  

---

## Strand E: Spatial Sense
### E1: Geometric and Spatial Reasoning
- E1.1: sort and identify 2D shapes by sides, vertices, and symmetry  
- E1.2: compose and decompose 2D shapes and 3D figures  
- E1.3: describe relative positions and movements (e.g., beside, above, slide, flip, turn)  

### E2: Measurement
- E2.1: compare and order objects by length, mass, and capacity using non-standard units  
- E2.2: tell time to the hour and half-hour, use calendars, and describe temperature

## Strand F: Financial Literacy
- F1.1: identify Canadian coins (penny, nickel, dime, quarter, loonie, toonie) and represent money amounts up to $1  
- F1.2: describe spending, saving, sharing, and donating in everyday contexts:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Cross-Strand Task (optional)
**Example**: *“Classroom Snack Shop”* – students use coins to buy items (F1), add/subtract costs (B2), track purchases in graphs (D1), and measure items like snack containers (E2).
