## Strand A: Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) Skills and Mathematical Processes
### Overall Expectation
- Apply SEL skills and mathematical processes (problem solving, reasoning, reflecting, representing, communicating, etc.) to support learning and well-being.

| Spec. ID | Skill focus | Worksheet links (vA–vD) | Assessment idea | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | SEL in math | `materials/worksheets/math/gr4/sel/A1_vA.md` … `vD.md` | Math talks, reflection journals | Assess within other strands |

## Strand F: Financial Literacy
- F1.1: identify various methods of payment used to purchase goods and services  
- F1.2: estimate and calculate costs of transactions involving multiple items priced in whole dollars (no tax), and calculate change using mental math
