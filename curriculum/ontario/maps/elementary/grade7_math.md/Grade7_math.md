## Strand A: Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) Skills and Mathematical Processes
### Overall Expectation
- Apply SEL skills and mathematical processes (problem solving, reasoning, reflecting, representing, connecting, communicating) to support learning and well-being.

| Spec. ID | Skill focus | Worksheet links (vA–vD) | Assessment idea | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | SEL in math contexts | `materials/worksheets/math/gr7/sel/A1_vA.md` … `vD.md` | Math reflections, collaborative strategy work | Assess within strands |
