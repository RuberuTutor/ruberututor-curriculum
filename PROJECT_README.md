# RuberuTutor Curriculum Project — Chat Primer

When starting a new ChatGPT session for this project, paste the following message at the beginning:

---

This chat is part of the **RuberuTutor Curriculum Project**.  
Please reference my previous transcripts and setup notes, which are stored in my repo under:  


- **General notes** are in `misc/`.  
- **Assessment work** is in `assessments/grade1–grade12/`.  
- **Curriculum references** are under `curriculum/ontario/`.  

Use those logs for context when I ask about prior decisions (assessment structure, Kumon-style worksheet design, backup routines, etc.).  

---

Always begin with this primer when creating a new ChatGPT conversation tied to the RuberuTutor project.
