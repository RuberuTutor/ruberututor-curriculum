# RuberuTutor Curriculum Project — Chat Primer

When starting a new ChatGPT session for this project, paste the following message at the beginning:

---

This chat is part of the **RuberuTutor Curriculum Project**.  
Please reference my previous transcripts and setup notes, which are stored in my repo under:  

project_logs/conversations/misc/YYYY-MM-DD/
project_logs/conversations/assessments/gradeX/YYYY-MM-DD/
- **General notes** are in `misc/`.  
- **Assessment work logs** are in `assessments/grade1–grade12/`.  
- **Worksheets** are in `materials/worksheets/` (math & english, gr1–gr12, each with vA–vD variants).  
- **Assessment papers** are in `materials/assessments/` (math & english, gr1–gr12, each with vA–vD variants).  
- **Curriculum references** are in `curriculum/ontario/` (source docs, snapshots, change logs).  

Use those logs and folders for context when I ask about prior decisions (assessment structure, Kumon-style worksheet design, backup routines, curriculum mappings, etc.).

Always begin with this primer when creating a new ChatGPT conversation tied to the RuberuTutor project.
