## Strand Coverage & Sample Solutions

### Strand A — Mathematical Thinking and Making Connections
- **Sample Question(s)**: Problem-solving, connecting math to real-life contexts.  
- **Answer / Rubric**:  
  - Full credit for clear explanation of strategy and correct solution.  
  - Partial credit for reasoning shown but incorrect answer.

### Strand B — Number
- **Sample Question(s)**: Rational numbers, exponents, proportions.  
- **Answer / Rubric**:  
  - Correct simplification or computation.  
  - Partial credit for setup but calculation errors.

### Strand C — Algebra
- **Sample Question(s)**: Algebraic manipulation, solving equations, interpreting graphs.  
- **Answer / Rubric**:  
  - Correct expansion, solving, or graph interpretation.  
  - Partial credit for showing correct steps but making arithmetic errors.

### Strand D — Data
- **Sample Question(s)**: Data representation, two-variable analysis, modelling.  
- **Answer / Rubric**:  
  - Correct graph/table and explanation.  
  - Credit for identifying relationships or trends.

### Strand E — Geometry and Measurement
- **Sample Question(s)**: Pythagorean theorem, trigonometry, area/volume.  
- **Answer / Rubric**:  
  - Correct formula use, labelled diagram if applicable.  
  - Partial credit for correct method but computational error.

### Strand F — Financial Literacy
- **Sample Question(s)**: Cost/benefit, decision-making scenarios.  
- **Answer / Rubric**:  
  - Credit for clear calculation and reasoning.  
  - Partial credit if reasoning is sound but minor error in arithmetic.

## Scoring Guidance
- **Strand weighting**: Equal across A–F.  
- **Overall placement**:  
  - 80–100% → student ready for Grade 9 worksheets at full pace.  
  - 60–79% → student may need support on weaker strands (start at targeted worksheets).  
  - <60% → student may need reinforcement from Grade 8 materials before moving on.
