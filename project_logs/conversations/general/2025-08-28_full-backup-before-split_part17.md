You said:
Or could we just ask the student what math or English class you are currently in and create a math or English assessment based on that class?
ChatGPT said:
💯 Yes — that’s actually the cleanest approach for Grades 9–12.

Instead of building a giant “Grade 11 Placement Test” that tries to cover all streams (academic, applied, college, university), you:

Ask the student (or parent) upfront:

“Which course are you currently in or enrolling for? (e.g., MCR3U – Functions, ENG3C – English College)”

Direct them to the correct assessment Form for that specific course.

If they choose MCR3U, they get the Grade 11 Functions Placement Test.

If they choose ENG4U, they get the Grade 12 University English Placement Test.

Result:

You only test the expectations that matter for that course.

The test is shorter, more accurate, less stressful.

✅ Benefits of this method:
Scalable: You don’t have to design “super-tests” that cover everything.

Easier to maintain: Just one assessment per Ontario course code.

Fairer: Students aren’t penalized for being in a different stream.

Clearer reporting: “Student is placed into ENG3C Strand B (Writing), Skill 3” → directly matches curriculum docs.

👉 So yes, the workflow could be:

Step 1: Student selects their course (from a dropdown or intake form).

Step 2: They get routed to the right Google Form (via link).

Step 3: Auto-placement happens inside that course’s Google Sheet.

Would you like me to map out a list of all the Gr 9–12 Math & English courses (with official Ontario codes) so you can see exactly how many assessments you’d need to build if you go this route?

You said:
That would mean that we would need to give new assessments as students take on other classes. But what if a student is taking more than one math class consecutively? Would that mean that we would give two test to the students? And how would we score such a test or both those tests together?Do students typically in high school in Ontario take two different math classes or two different English classes at the same time
ChatGPT said:
Excellent set of questions 👌 — let’s unpack step by step.

🔹 Do Ontario high school students take two different Math/English courses at the same time?
Math: Students normally take one math course per semester (e.g., MPM2D in Grade 10, then MCR3U in Grade 11). Some keen or advanced students take two math courses in one year (e.g., MHF4U and MCV4U in Grade 12) — but not usually in the same semester.

English: English is usually one credit per year. It’s rare for students to double up in English, unless they’re catching up or accelerating.

👉 So most students take one Math + one English in any given semester, not two at once.

🔹 If a student is moving into a new course (e.g., finished MPM2D and now taking MCR3U):
Yes, they’d need to take the placement assessment for the new course.

That’s because each course has different expectations/skills — being good in Gr 10 Applied Math (MFM2P) doesn’t mean readiness for Gr 11 Functions (MCR3U).

🔹 Scoring across multiple assessments
Each assessment is scored independently.

If a student takes two courses in sequence, you just evaluate each separately.

You don’t merge results — instead, you say:

“In MPM2D (Grade 10 Academic), student placed into Strand C skill 3.”

“In MCR3U (Grade 11 Functions), student placed into Strand A skill 2.”

That keeps placement course-specific, which aligns perfectly with how Ontario curriculum is structured.

🔹 Why this is actually simpler
Think of high school placement as course-entry assessments:

Every time a student starts a new Math or English course, they do one short placement test for that course.

Since each assessment is scoped tightly to that course’s expectations, it’s shorter, more precise, and easier to mark.

✅ So the answer:

No, students don’t usually take 2 English/Maths at once.

If they progress into another course, yes, they take a new test.

Results are not combined; each assessment is linked to the specific course.

👉 Do you want me to outline all Ontario high school Math + English courses (Gr 9–12) and show which ones would need their own placement test, so you have the full roadmap?

You said:
Wouldn’t each one of them require an assessment test? Do you think that there are courses that do not require an assessment test?
ChatGPT said:
Great thinking 👌 — let’s check this carefully.

🔹 In principle
Yes — every course could have its own assessment test, because each has unique expectations. But in practice, not all courses need one.

🔹 When you definitely need a placement test
Core pathways (most common student routes):

Math: Academic/Applied in Gr 9–10 → Functions → Advanced Functions → Calculus.

English: ENG1D → ENG2D → ENG3U/C → ENG4U/C.

Reason: Students enter these with very different prior learning, so you need to diagnose starting point in the strands.

🔹 When you may not need a placement test
Elective or non-core courses (e.g., Grade 12 Mathematics of Data Management MDM4U, or Writer’s Craft ENG4U elective).

These courses don’t have as much prior-skill scaffolding — students can usually start from scratch since the teacher begins with basics.

Applied/college-level courses taken after academic ones. Sometimes these overlap so much that you could reuse part of an existing assessment instead of making a new one.

Very niche electives (e.g., Media Studies in English) — placement doesn’t matter as much, since success depends more on engagement and project work than on scaffolding skills.

🔹 Streamlined approach
You could design assessments only for:

Every Math pathway course that builds on previous strands.

e.g., MPM1D, MFM1P, MPM2D, MFM2P, MCR3U, MHF4U, MCV4U.

That’s maybe 7–8 tests instead of 12+.

Every core English course (ENG1–4, U/C streams).

That’s 4–6 tests instead of 10+.

Optional: Add tests for electives if you see demand.

✅ So: Not all courses need placement tests. Focus on the core Math + core English sequences, since that’s where diagnostic placement really matters.

👉 Do you want me to draft a shortlist of “essential” assessment tests (the minimum you’d realistically need to cover Grades 9–12 pathways), so you don’t overbuild?

You said:
So I can basically tell you, which course is a student is taking and you can tell me if they required an assessment test or not
ChatGPT said:
✅ Exactly! That’s the right way to think about it.

If you tell me:

“This student is about to start MCR3U (Functions, Gr 11 Academic Math)” → I’d say yes, give a placement test, because Functions builds directly on Gr 10 math strands.

“This student is starting ENG4U (English, Gr 12 University)” → yes, placement test, because writing, reading, and analysis skills build step by step.

“This student is taking Media Studies (EMS3O, elective English)” → no placement test needed, since it’s project-based and doesn’t rely on cumulative grammar/writing skills.

So the rule of thumb is:

Core, sequential courses (Math & English that lead to graduation) → need placement.

Electives or “fresh start” courses (like Writer’s Craft, Media Studies, Data Management) → no placement.

👉 Do you want me to build you a reference chart of Ontario high school Math + English courses with a simple YES/NO column for “Placement Test Required”? That way, you can just check it whenever a new student enrolls.

You said:
We can do that later
ChatGPT said:
👍 Perfect — we’ll park that for later.

Let’s stay focused step-by-step. Right now, you’ve confirmed:

We’re doing strand-wide placement assessments (not skill-by-skill).

Worksheets and assessments will be stored + versioned in your GitHub/Dropbox repo.

All assessments will be online only, ideally timed.

Placement will start at the first weak skill within the weak strand.

No “bonus questions” on ordinary worksheets.

Each worksheet will have multiple variants (A, B, C).

👉 Next question for clarity:
When we build the online assessments (Google Forms or similar), do you want them to be auto-graded multiple choice/fill-in-the-blank only, or are you open to including short written responses that a teacher would need to review manually?

You said:

I want them to be fully automated without any short written responses that would require a review
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ✅ — fully automated grading only.

👉 Next question: For auto-graded items, do you prefer multiple choice only, or are you okay with numeric short-answer too (e.g., student types 47), as long as it’s auto-marked?

If numeric is allowed, should we accept equivalent formats (e.g., 1/2 and 0.5), and should units ever be required?

You said:
Everything should be multiple-choice in order to avoid confusion
ChatGPT said:
Got it 👍 — all placement test items will be multiple-choice only. That keeps it simple, avoids typos, and guarantees full auto-grading.

👉 Next question: Do you want the answer choices randomized for each student (so no two students see the same order), or should they always appear in the same order?

You said:
They will all be presented in the same order because that will allow us to stabilize the assessment process. I don’t want to have multiple sheets for variation in assessments. Is it possible to have variation in assessments and still only use one sheet?
ChatGPT said:
Great point 👌 — stability is important if you want to compare results across students.

Here’s how this works:

Same sheet, no variation → Every student sees the same test, in the same order. Easiest to manage, but if students share questions/answers, it’s easier to “leak.”

One sheet, variation enabled → Google Forms (and many platforms) let you shuffle answer choices or even pull random questions from a larger bank, while still using one single assessment link.

Example: You create a bank of 30 questions for Gr 9 Algebra.

The form can automatically pull 20 random ones per student.

Everyone uses the same assessment link, but no two students get an identical test.

That way, you don’t manage multiple sheets, but you still get variation for fairness and security.

👉 So the choice is:

Option A: Stable test (all students same order/questions).

Option B: Dynamic test (same sheet link, but randomized questions/answers).

Would you prefer Option A (stable) to keep everything consistent, or Option B (dynamic) to reduce risk of copying?

You said:
Is it more difficult to create a dynamic test?
ChatGPT said:
Not really ✨ — the setup effort is almost the same.

Stable test (Option A) → you just enter your 20–30 questions once in Google Forms. Done.

Dynamic test (Option B) → you still enter the same 20–30 questions, but you tick boxes like “shuffle answer order” or use the built-in “question bank” feature (Google Forms calls them “sections with randomized question blocks”).

The only extra step is telling Forms how many questions to randomly pull from the bank (e.g., “give each student 20 random questions out of 30”).

The grading and the results sheet stay exactly the same — you still get one spreadsheet of scores.

👉 Do you want me to map out the workflow for creating a dynamic test in Google Forms step by step so you can see how easy it is?

You said:
No, let’s go to the next question but keep it recorded that we’re going to do dynamic assessments as you are explaining
ChatGPT said:
✅ Noted and recorded: we’ll be doing dynamic assessments — one sheet per strand, with a question bank inside Google Forms that randomizes which questions each student sees.

👉 Next question: When students finish their online assessment, do you want them to see their score and correct answers immediately, or should the results be hidden from students and only sent to you (so they don’t know what they got wrong)?

You said:
I should be the only one to see the results and then interpret and then give them an explanation of where they are going to be.
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 — results will be hidden from students. Only you (the instructor) will see the full score and breakdown, and you’ll interpret and explain placement to families.

👉 Next question: When you receive results, do you want the Google Sheet to automatically flag the weak strand/skill (e.g., “B1-Number Sense: 65%”) so you don’t have to calculate manually, or do you prefer to just see raw scores and interpret them yourself?

You said:
I want Google sheets to automatically flag the week trans/skill
ChatGPT said:
Great — we’ll build the Google Sheet to auto-flag the first weak strand/skill using formulas (and highlight it), plus a Placement column that fills itself in. 👍

👉 Next question: Timing rules. What should the time limit be per assessment (by grade or course)?

For example:

Gr 1–3: 20 minutes

Gr 4–6: 25 minutes

Gr 7–8: 30 minutes

High school (per course test): 35–45 minutes

Do you want a schedule like that, or a single fixed time for all tests?

You said:
I think your examples are great younger children will not be able to sit for longer periods
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
Awesome — I’ll lock these time limits unless you want changes:

Gr 1–3: 20 minutes

Gr 4–6: 25 minutes

Gr 7–8: 30 minutes

High school (per course): 40 minutes

👉 Confirm?

You said:
Confirmed
ChatGPT said:
✅ Confirmed — we’ll use those grade-based time limits for all assessments.

👉 Next question: Do you want each assessment to have a fixed number of questions (e.g., always 20 per test), or should the number of questions vary with grade (fewer for younger students, more for older students)?

You said:
The number of questions should vary
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 — variable question counts by grade will help keep tests age-appropriate.

Here’s a suggested structure (aligned with your earlier guideline of min 10 questions for reliability, but not overwhelming):

Gr 1–3 → 10–12 questions

Gr 4–6 → 15–18 questions

Gr 7–8 → 20 questions

High school (per course) → 25–30 questions

👉 Do you want me to lock in this structure, or would you like to adjust the numbers?

You said:
Lock it in lock it in
ChatGPT said:
✅ Locked in:

Gr 1–3 → 10–12 questions

Gr 4–6 → 15–18 questions

Gr 7–8 → 20 questions

High school → 25–30 questions

👉 Next question: For scoring, do you want Google Sheets to automatically mark 90% or higher = mastery/pass and flag below 90% = placement in that strand, or would you like more nuanced thresholds (e.g., 80–89% = borderline, below 80% = clear weakness)?

You said:
I want to use the same strict standards so we will use the program. Above 90% is mastery below 90% is where we start working. The lowest grades is where we start work.
