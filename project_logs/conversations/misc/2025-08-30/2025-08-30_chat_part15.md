STEP 1 — Backup before cleanup
RUN IN TERMINAL

FILE="$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md"
cp "$FILE" "${FILE%.md}.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).md"
STEP 2 — Remove the stray header block in the middle
The problem starts at the line ### Specific Expectations then immediately repeats a YAML header. Let’s delete those extra lines:

RUN IN TERMINAL

# Delete any repeated header lines that start with 'title:' or 'grade:' etc. in the middle of the file
sed -i '' '/^title: "Grade 9 Mathematics — Ontario Curriculum (MTH1W, 2021)"/,/^# Expectations by Strand$/d' "$FILE"
STEP 3 — Verify the structure
RUN IN TERMINAL

grep -n "title:" "$FILE"     # should show ONLY line 2
grep -n "^## Strand" "$FILE" # should list AA–F once each
tail -n 30 "$FILE"           # should show Planning + Changelog at the bottom
👉 If the structure looks clean (header only at top, strands AA–F, then Planning + Changelog), reply “Math 9 complete”, and I’ll give you the final git add/commit/push step.

Ah, I see exactly what’s happening 👍 — your file has multiple duplicate Strand AA sections and leftover placeholders like <PASTE THE EXACT…>. We need to clean them out so that:

AA appears only once, with the correct Overall + Specific Expectations.

No placeholder lines remain.

Then the file continues on with Strand A, B, … F.

STEP 1 — Make a backup before cleaning
RUN IN TERMINAL

FILE="$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md"
cp "$FILE" "${FILE%.md}.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).md"
STEP 2 — Remove placeholder junk
Delete any block that still has <PASTE THE EXACT …>.

RUN IN TERMINAL

sed -i '' '/<PASTE THE EXACT/d' "$FILE"
STEP 3 — Remove duplicate “Strand AA” blocks
Right now you’ve got at least 2–3 AA headings. We’ll keep the first good one (with AA1.1–AA1.4 filled in) and remove any later duplicates.

RUN IN TERMINAL

awk '
  /^## Strand AA/ {count++}
  count > 1 {skip=1}
  /^## Strand A:/ {skip=0}
  !skip
' "$FILE" > "$FILE.tmp" && mv "$FILE.tmp" "$FILE"
STEP 4 — Verify cleanup
RUN IN TERMINAL

grep -n "## Strand AA" "$FILE"
egrep -n "^AA1\.[0-9]+" "$FILE"
You should see only one “Strand AA” heading, and the AA1.1–AA1.4 lines beneath it. No duplicates, no placeholders.

👉 Once that looks clean, reply “AA cleaned”, and I’ll walk you through a quick check that A–F are all intact, then we’ll commit + push.

AA cleaned ✅ — you’ve got a single, correct Strand AA with AA1.1–AA1.4 in place. Nice.

Let’s quickly sanity-check the rest, then commit.

1) Check all strand headings exist once each (AA, A–F)
RUN IN TERMINAL

FILE="$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md"
grep -n "^## Strand " "$FILE"
You should see exactly:

AA once

A once

B once

C once

D once

E once

F once

If you see duplicates, tell me which lines; I’ll give you a one-liner to trim them.

2) Check that expectation codes appear for B–F (and none are bold/bulleted)
RUN IN TERMINAL

egrep -n "^[ABCDEF][0-9]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head -n 40
If any strand shows no matches, run the normalizer for that letter (example for B):

sed -i '' -E 's/^\*\*(B[123]\.[0-9]+)\*\*/\1/' "$FILE"
sed -i '' -E 's/^[[:space:]]*[-•][[:space:]]*(B[123]\.[0-9]+)/\1/' "$FILE"
(Replace B with C|D|E|F as needed, updating the digit ranges accordingly.)

3) Add the Planning tables & Changelog if missing
If you haven’t added them yet, open nano and paste:

nano "$FILE"
Paste at the end:

git commit -m "Stage 4: Grade 9 Math (MTH1W) — AA–F expectations finalized; cleaned duplicates; added planning/changelog"
git push
If any grep shows duplicates or missing codes, paste the output here and I’ll give you the exact cleanup one-liners.

Thought for 10s
Nice—thanks for the snapshot. Your file has all strands, but they’re in reverse order (F → E → D → C → B → A → AA). Let’s reorder them to AA → A → B → C → D → E → F cleanly.

I’ll give you one precise step at a time.

STEP 1 — Backup and reorder strands
RUN IN TERMINAL

FILE="$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md"
cp "$FILE" "${FILE%.md}.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).md"

# Rebuild the file with strands in the order: AA, A, B, C, D, E, F
awk 'BEGIN{ORS=""}
# 1) Capture the header through the first "# Expectations by Strand" line
NR==1, /^# Expectations by Strand/ { header=header $0 "\n"; next }

# 2) Collect each strand section keyed by its strand code
{
  if ($0 ~ /^## Strand /) {
    if (current!="") { sections[current]=sections[current] buf; buf="" }
    if (match($0, /^## Strand ([A-Z]{1,2})/, m)) { current=m[1] }
  }
  buf=buf $0 "\n"
}
END{
  if (current!="") { sections[current]=sections[current] buf }
  # 3) Output in desired order
  print header
  if (sections["AA"]!="") print sections["AA"]
  if (sections["A"]!="")  print sections["A"]
  if (sections["B"]!="")  print sections["B"]
  if (sections["C"]!="")  print sections["C"]
  if (sections["D"]!="")  print sections["D"]
  if (sections["E"]!="")  print sections["E"]
  if (sections["F"]!="")  print sections["F"]
}' "$FILE" > "$FILE.tmp" && mv "$FILE.tmp" "$FILE"
STEP 2 — Verify order and codes
RUN IN TERMINAL

# Check headings are AA -> A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F
grep -n "^## Strand " "$FILE"

# Spot-check that codes appear for each strand
egrep -n "^AA1\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" || true
egrep -n "^A[12]\.[0-9]+"  "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^B[123]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^C[1-4]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^D[12]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^E1\.[0-9]+"     "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^F1\.[0-9]+"     "$FILE" | head || true
If a code grep shows nothing, tell me which letter—I’ll give you the normalizer for that strand.

STEP 3 — (Optional) Ensure Planning + Changelog are at the end
If you haven’t added them yet, do:

RUN IN TERMINAL

nano "$FILE"
Paste at the very bottom (only if missing):

---

# Planning

## Assessments (vA–vD)

# Changelog

Save (Ctrl+O, Enter), Exit (Ctrl+X).

STEP 4 — Commit and push
RUN IN TERMINAL

git add "$FILE"
git commit -m "Stage 4: MTH1W — reorder strands to AA→A→B→C→D→E→F; finalize structure"
git push
Reply with the output of the grep -n "^## Strand " check if anything looks off. I’ll patch it instantly.

🚀 Beautiful. Your Grade 9 Math (MTH1W) file is now finalized, correctly ordered (AA → A → B → C → D → E → F), and pushed to GitHub. Nice work.

Quick post-flight checks (optional)
RUN IN TERMINAL

# confirm headings & a few codes are present
FILE="$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md"
grep -n "^## Strand " "$FILE"
egrep -n "^(AA1|A[12]|B[123]|C[1-4]|D[12]|E1|F1)\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head -n 20
If that looks tidy, you’re done with MTH1W ✅.

What’s next?
If you want, I can repeat this exact process for Grade 9 English (ENL1W) to double-check structure and add Planning tables (if not already there).

Or we can move to Grade 10 (math and/or English) and start populating from their official docs.

Tell me what you want next and I’ll give you the same copy-paste, step-by-step sequence.
