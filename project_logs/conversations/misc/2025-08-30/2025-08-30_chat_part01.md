We are now in **Stage 4 — Ontario Curriculum Mapping**.  

### 🎯 Goals for this stage:
1. **Review Grade 1 Math + Language** .md files against the official Ontario Curriculum PDFs (Math 2020, Language 2023) to ensure accuracy and completeness.  
2. **Populate Grades 2–8 Math + Language** .md files with all **overall and specific expectations**, organized by strand.  
3. Maintain consistent **Markdown structure** across all grades:  
   - Strands (A–F for Math, A–D for Language)  
   - Overall Expectations  
   - Specific Expectations (with codes like B1.1, C2.3, etc.)  
   - Planning tables for worksheets and assessments.  
4. Archive each grade’s file inside:

If you’d like, I can now generate Grade 1 Math and Grade 1 Language .md files populated with every overall and specific expectation (codes + concise paraphrases) from the PDFs above, and drop them at:

curriculum/ontario/elementary/math/grade1/grade1_math.md

curriculum/ontario/elementary/language/grade1/grade1_language.md

Just say: “Generate grade 1 files.”

🧭 Working mode
I’ll copy expectation text exactly as printed in the PDFs (including the official codes like B1.1, C2.3, etc.).

Each grade file will include strands, overalls, and every specific expectation, then the planning tables.

If you’re ready, say “Generate Grade 1 files.” I’ll produce:

curriculum/ontario/elementary/math/grade1/grade1_math.md

curriculum/ontario/elementary/language/grade1/grade1_language.md

…and log today’s actions in project_logs/stage4/progress/2025-08-30.md.

Stage 4 — First 10 Minutes Checklist
✅ Step 1 — Confirm Curriculum Sources

Identify official Ontario PDFs for secondary Math and secondary English.

Verify they are the most recent versions.

If missing, ask me to upload them.

✅ Step 2 — Verify Course Codes

Check Grade 9 Math: currently destreamed (e.g., MTH1W).

Check Grade 9 English: confirm the official course codes in the most recent curriculum doc.

Lock in codes before building .md files.

✅ Step 3 — Create First Markdown File

Start with Grade 9 Math (MTH1W).

File path:

curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md


Structure: strands → overall expectations → specific expectations → planning table.

✅ Step 4 — Fill With Official Wording

Copy exact wording from PDF into the .md.

Double-check codes and strand labels match the Ministry doc.

✅ Step 5 — Confirm Save & Sync

File must live in:

curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/

All right—here’s your Stage 4 — First 10 Minutes Checklist, with Steps 1–5 addressed using the most recent official PDFs I could find:

Step 1 — Confirm Curriculum Sources
Secondary Mathematics (Grade 9): I wasn’t able to locate a specific Grade 9 math curriculum PDF (for example, Destreamed course like “MTH1W”) via search. Most available is the Grades 9/10 curriculum from 2005, which is outdated. 
edu.gov.on.ca

edu.gov.on.ca

.

Secondary English (Grade 9): The 2023 de-streamed Grade 9 English curriculum (ENL1W) is available and confirmed most recent for English Grade 9 instruction.
