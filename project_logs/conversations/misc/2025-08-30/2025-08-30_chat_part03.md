You said:
done
ChatGPT said:
✅ Excellent — you now have the entire Grade 1 Math curriculum map filled with official expectations for Number, Data, Algebra, Spatial Sense, and Financial Literacy.

Step 12 — Review & Lock In Grade 1 Math
1. Quick review of all strands
Run this to see just the expectation lines:

grep "B" curriculum/ontario/maps/grade1_math.md
grep "C" curriculum/ontario/maps/grade1_math.md
grep "D" curriculum/ontario/maps/grade1_math.md
grep "E" curriculum/ontario/maps/grade1_math.md
grep "F" curriculum/ontario/maps/grade1_math.md
That should print all the official text for B (Number), C (Algebra), D (Data), E (Spatial Sense), F (Financial Literacy).

2. Confirm structure
Run this to make sure the section headers are there:

grep "## Strand" curriculum/ontario/maps/grade1_math.md
You should see:

## Strand: Number
## Strand: Data
## Strand: Algebra
## Strand: Spatial Sense
## Strand: Financial Literacy
👉 Once you’ve confirmed the review looks good, reply “Grade 1 Math locked”. Then we’ll begin Step 13 (Grade 1 Language map placeholders).

✅ Perfect — your grade1_math.md file now contains every Grade 1 math expectation across all strands. The extra leftover placeholders in the tables (- D1:, - F1: etc.) are fine for now — they’re meant to be filled when we start adding Skill Focus, Worksheets, and Assessments.

That means:

Number (B) ✔️ filled

Algebra (C) ✔️ filled

Data (D) ✔️ filled

Spatial Sense (E) ✔️ filled

Financial Literacy (F) ✔️ filled

Next Step: Grade 1 Language
We’ll now repeat the process for Language (English).

Step 13 — Create the Grade 1 Language Map File
In terminal, make the file:

## How to use
- Copy the *official wording* of each expectation.
- For each specific expectation, plan later:
  - Worksheets: vA (easiest) → vD (hardest)
  - Assessment: 1–2 tasks that test mastery
