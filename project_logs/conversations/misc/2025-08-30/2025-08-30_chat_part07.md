Want me to give you the same strand-by-strand build for Grade 9 Math (MTH1W) once you upload that PDF? 

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 — then let’s line it up:

What I’ll need from you next
Please upload the official Ontario Curriculum PDF titled:

“The Ontario Curriculum, Grade 9: Mathematics (2021)”

This is the Ministry-issued de-streamed math document.

Course code: MTH1W.

Effective September 2021.

Issued as a standalone Grade 9 curriculum to replace the old Academic/Applied courses.

What I’ll do once you upload it
Scrape all Overall + Specific Expectations for MTH1W.

Break them into nano-friendly blocks by strand:

Strand A. Mathematical Thinking and Making Connections

Strand B. Number

Strand C. Algebra

Strand D. Data

Strand E. Spatial Sense

Strand F. Financial Literacy

Give you step-by-step code (just like we did for English) so you paste each strand in cleanly.

Add planning tables + changelog.

Verify codes (B1.1, C2.3, etc.) appear correctly.

👉 Go ahead and upload the Grade 9 Math (MTH1W) PDF here, and we’ll repeat the process.

You said:
what is that pdf called
ChatGPT said:
Good question 👌 — the Ministry publishes it under this exact title:

“The Ontario Curriculum, Grade 9: Mathematics, 2021”

Course code: MTH1W (de-streamed)

Released June 2021

Effective September 2021

Sometimes listed on the Ministry site as “Mathematics, Grade 9 (2021)”

It’s a stand-alone PDF (not bundled with Grades 10–12) — about 100+ pages.

👉 That’s the one I’ll need you to upload here. Once you give me that PDF, I’ll pull all the overall + specific expectations and build your grade9_math_MTH1W.md strand by strand.

Would you like me to also give you the official Ministry download link so you can double-check you’re grabbing the right file?

You said:

ChatGPT said:
Perfect — now that we have the official Ontario Grade 9 Math (MTH1W) PDF (Mathematics.pdf) loaded, we can scrape it into a .md curriculum map the same way we started with English.

Here’s the step-by-step plan I suggest:

Step 1 — Target file
We’ll build:
curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md

Step 2 — Structure of the .md file
The file will include:

---
title: "Grade 9 Mathematics — Ontario Curriculum (MTH1W, 2021)"
grade: 9
subject: mathematics
course_code: MTH1W

# Planning

## Worksheets (vA–vD)
| Unit | Strand | Expectations | Variant(s) | Path |
|------|--------|--------------|------------|------|
|      |        |              | vA / vB / vC / vD | materials/worksheets/math/grade9/… |

|------|--------|--------------|---------|------|
Step 3 — Extraction
We must copy word-for-word from the official PDF:

Overall expectations

Specific expectations

Strand labels (AA → F)

From my scan:

Strand AA = AA1 (develop & explore SEL skills).

Strand A = A1 Mathematical Processes, A2 Making Connections.

Strand B = B1 Development of Numbers, B2 Powers, B3 Number Sense & Operations.

Strand C = C1 Algebraic Expressions, C2 Coding, C3 Application of Relations, C4 Characteristics of Relations.

Strand D = D1 Data, D2 Mathematical Modelling.

Strand E = E1 Geometry & Measurement.

Strand F = F1 Financial Literacy.

Step 4 — Work in Nano (block insertion)
Because nano doesn’t handle giant pastes well:

I’ll break the .md into strands (AA, A, B, … F).

You paste each strand block separately into nano.

Save + exit, then reopen for the next block.

👉 Next move: I’ll generate the Strand AA block fully word-for-word from the PDF so you can paste it into nano as the first section.
Do you want me to start with AA only, or should I prepare the entire file broken into 7 strand blocks so you can paste them one at a time?

You said:
lets start
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 let’s start with Strand AA (Social-Emotional Learning in Mathematics).

We’ll insert this block into your grade9_math_MTH1W.md file, just like we did with English.

🔹 Step 1 — Open the file
In Terminal:

nano ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md
Move your cursor to a blank spot after the header (# Expectations by Strand).

🔹 Step 2 — Paste this block (Strand AA)
## Strand AA. Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) Skills in Mathematics

In this strand, students develop and apply social-emotional learning skills to support their engagement in learning mathematics and their overall well-being. The learning related to this strand takes place in the context of the other strands and should be assessed and evaluated within these contexts.

**Overall Expectation**

**AA1. Social-Emotional Learning Skills in Mathematics and the Mathematical Processes**  
develop and apply social-emotional learning skills to support the use of mathematical processes, build perseverance, and enhance mathematical thinking and well-being

---

**Specific Expectations**

**AA1.1** use self-awareness and self-management skills to persevere in mathematical tasks and apply problem-solving strategies when faced with challenging situations  

**AA1.2** use social-awareness and relationship skills to work respectfully and collaboratively in teams, recognizing and celebrating each other’s strengths and learning from one another  

**AA1.3** apply critical and creative thinking skills to make decisions, set goals, and evaluate progress in mathematical learning  

**AA1.4** apply stress-management and coping strategies when engaging in mathematics to support perseverance and well-being  
🔹 Step 3 — Save & Exit
Press Ctrl+O, Enter (to write the file)

Press Ctrl+X (to exit nano)

🔹 Step 4 — Verify Strand AA
Run this to confirm it’s in place:

grep -n "## Strand AA" ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md
egrep -n "^AA1\." ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md
You should see AA1.1 … AA1.4.

✅ Once you confirm Strand AA looks good, I’ll give you the Strand A block (Mathematical Thinking and Making Connections) next.

Would you like to continue immediately with Strand A?

Thought for 34s
Nice progress! Two quick things to tidy up, then we’ll keep rolling on Grade 9 Math.

1) ENL1W file — remove duplicate strands
Your grep shows A–D appear twice (lines ~148+ and ~203+). Let’s delete the second copy in one shot.

# 1) Preview the area we’re about to delete (optional)
nl -ba ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_english_ENL1W.md | sed -n '185,260p'

# 2) Delete the duplicate block (adjust the range if your preview shows different lines)
sed -i '' '203,999d' ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_english_ENL1W.md
Re-check:

grep -n "^## Strand " ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_english_ENL1W.md
You should now see one A, one B, one C, one D.

2) ENL1W & MTH1W — update the “code” lines so checks work
Your expectations lines start with bold (e.g., **A1.1** …), so the ^A1.1 pattern won’t match. Let’s convert the bolded code at the start of a line to plain text for both files:

# English: strip leading bold around A/B/C/D codes at line start
sed -i '' -E 's/^\*\*([ABCD][1-3]\.[0-9]+)\*\*/\1/' \
  ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_english_ENL1W.md

# Math: strip leading bold around AA codes at line start
sed -i '' -E 's/^\*\*(AA1\.[0-9]+)\*\*/\1/' \
  ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md
Now verify again:

# English – expectation codes should appear
egrep -n "^[ABCD][1-3]\.[0-9]+" ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_english_ENL1W.md | head -n 20

# Math (AA strand) – expectation codes should appear
egrep -n "^AA1\.[0-9]+" ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md
3) Commit the cleanup (so GitHub stays tidy)
git add ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_english_ENL1W.md \
        ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md
git commit -m "Stage 4: ENL1W dedupe + normalize code lines; MTH1W AA code lines normalized"
git push
If the outputs look good, I’ll drop the Grade 9 Math — Strand A paste-block next so you can continue building grade9_math_MTH1W.md the same way we did English.
