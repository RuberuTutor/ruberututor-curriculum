Secondary Structure

Created placeholder .md files for Grades 10–12 English & Math in
curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/.

Ensured repo now has clean separation between Elementary (done in Stages 1–3) and Secondary (Stage 4 onward).

🎯 Next Steps — Stage 5 (Secondary Curriculum Mapping)

Grade 10–12 English & Math

Extract expectations verbatim from official Ontario Curriculum PDFs/Word docs.

Populate .md files:

Strands → Overall Expectations → Specific Expectations → Planning → Changelog.

Confirm course codes (ENG2D/ENL2W, MPM2D/MTH2W, etc.) against latest Ministry documents.

Cross-Check & Verification

Spot-check at least 5 codes per strand to confirm accuracy vs. PDFs.

Ensure no duplication, missing expectations, or placeholder text remains.

Worksheet/Assessment Integration

Use planning tables to start drafting vA–vD worksheet/assessment outlines.

Link each to correct path in materials/worksheets/ and materials/assessments/.

Logging & Changelogs

Every session’s decisions go into
project_logs/conversations/misc/YYYY-MM-DD/2025-09-XX_progress.md.

Each .md file ends with a Changelog section (date + summary).

Final Review & Freeze

Once all Grades 9–12 maps are populated, lock down Stage 5.

Begin Stage 6: Curriculum → Worksheet alignment (generating content from the maps).

⚡ Today’s Milestone:
Grade 9 Math (MTH1W) and English (ENL1W) are now fully built, verified, and logged — serving as the blueprint for all remaining secondary courses.
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ✅ — this is a clean, professional Stage 4 wrap-up summary.

Here’s how I suggest you use it going forward:

Save it in your repo as part of your logs, e.g.:

project_logs/conversations/misc/2025-08-30/2025-08-30_stage4_summary.md
That way, Stage 5 can always reference it as the official checkpoint.

Add a one-liner changelog entry inside 2025-08-30_progress.md:

- Stage 4 finalized: Grade 9 ENL1W & MTH1W complete; Stage 4 summary saved as 2025-08-30_stage4_summary.md.
Use this text as the opener for Stage 5 (in your new chat titled
5th Stage-Secondary Curriculum Mapping), so it picks up exactly where Stage 4 left off.

⚡ Quick question for you:
Do you want me to draft the exact cat <<'MD' terminal block so you can paste this summary directly into a new .md file in the right repo folder, without having to retype anything?

Perfect ✅ — here’s your **kickoff package for Stage 5**.

# RuberuTutor Curriculum Project — Primer for Stage 5

This chat is part of the **RuberuTutor Curriculum Project**.
Please reference my previous transcripts and setup notes, which are stored in my repo under:

project_logs/conversations/misc/YYYY-MM-DD/
project_logs/conversations/assessments/gradeX/YYYY-MM-DD/


* **General notes** → misc/
* **Assessment logs** → assessments/grade1–grade12/
* **Worksheets** → materials/worksheets/ (math & english, gr1–gr12, vA–vD)
* **Assessments** → materials/assessments/ (math & english, gr1–gr12, vA–vD)
* **Curriculum references** → curriculum/ontario/ (source docs, snapshots, change logs)

## 📍 Stage 5 — Secondary Curriculum Mapping (Grades 10–12)

### ✅ Completed in Stage 4 (2025-08-29 & 2025-08-30)

* **Elementary (Grades 1–8)**: finished (Stages 1–3).
* **Grade 9 Math (MTH1W)**: all strands AA–F populated verbatim, codes normalized, planning tables added.
* **Grade 9 English (ENL1W)**: all strands A–D populated verbatim, codes normalized, planning tables added.
* Repo clean: .gitignore ignores backups/tmp, placeholders for grades 10–12 created.

---

### 🎯 Goals for Stage 5

1. **Populate Grade 10–12 Math + English** .md files with official expectations (overall + specific).

   * Math: strands AA–F.
   * English: strands A–D.
   * Confirm correct course codes (ENG2D, ENL2W, MPM2D, MTH2W, etc.) from latest Ontario docs.

2. **Maintain Consistency**

   * Markdown format = **Strand → Overall Expectations → Specific Expectations → Planning → Changelog**.
   * Codes (C3.2, D1.4, etc.) must match Ministry docs.

3. **Verification**

   * Spot-check at least 5 expectations per strand against PDFs/Word docs.
   * Ensure no placeholders or duplicate strands remain.

4. **Integration**

   * Fill **Planning tables** for worksheets & assessments (vA–vD).
   * Link to correct repo paths under materials/worksheets/ and materials/assessments/.

5. **Logging**

   * Every session adds a new log entry in:
     project_logs/conversations/misc/YYYY-MM-DD/2025-09-XX_progress.md.
   * Each .md file ends with a dated **Changelog**.

Would you like me to also prepare the **first 10-minute checklist for Stage 5** (like we did in Stage 4), so you have a step-by-step starting sequence for the new chat?
ChatGPT said:
Got it ✅ — I’ll prepare the Stage 5 First 10-Minute Checklist so your new chat can hit the ground running just like Stage 4.

Here’s the package you’ll paste after the primer into the new chat:

Stage 5 — First 10 Minutes Checklist
✅ Step 1 — Confirm Curriculum Sources
Identify the official Ontario PDFs/Word docs for:

Grade 10–12 Math

Grade 10–12 English

Verify each is the most recent Ministry version.

If missing, ask me to upload them before continuing.

✅ Step 2 — Verify Course Codes
Grade 10: confirm current codes (e.g., MPM2D vs. MTH2W, ENG2D vs. ENL2W).

Grade 11 & 12: confirm streams (University, College, Workplace, etc.).

Lock in correct course codes before building .md files.

✅ Step 3 — Create First Markdown File
Start with Grade 10 Math (MTH2W or equivalent).

File path:

curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade10_math_<COURSECODE>.md
Structure = Strands → Overall Expectations → Specific Expectations → Planning → Changelog.

✅ Step 4 — Fill With Official Wording
Copy expectations word-for-word from the Ministry PDF/Word doc.

Double-check codes, strand labels, and formatting against official doc.

No placeholders left behind.

✅ Step 5 — Confirm Save & Sync
File must live in:

curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/
Log decisions in:

project_logs/conversations/misc/YYYY-MM-DD/
⚡ Key rule: If at any point codes or strands look inconsistent, pause and verify against the official source before proceeding.

Would you like me to also draft the exact cat <<'MD' terminal block for this checklist, so you can drop it straight into your repo logs as the Stage 5 kickoff note?

when we restart this tomorrow I will need for you to resume this work , step by step in an easy way for me to copy and paste code into terminal. You are required to create all documents from source documents without and missing information. Iyou don't have sufficient information, you will request it and tell me which documents you need for me to obtain in word format.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 22s
Absolutely. I’ll resume tomorrow with step-by-step, paste-ready terminal blocks. I’ll extract every expectation verbatim from your Word sources and flag anything missing, plus tell you exactly which Word docs I need.

Here’s your kickoff kit for tomorrow—copy blocks as-is into Terminal when you’re ready.

1) What to upload tomorrow (Word format)
Please have these official Ontario Curriculum Word docs ready (latest versions):

Grade 10 Mathematics (Word)

Grade 10 English (Word)

Grade 11 Mathematics (Word)

Grade 11 English (Word)

Grade 12 Mathematics (Word)

Grade 12 English (Word)

Tip: save them under source_docs/secondary/<subject>/ with clear names, e.g.

source_docs/secondary/math/grade10_math_official.docx
source_docs/secondary/english/grade10_english_official.docx
If any course codes are unclear in the docs, I’ll ask you to confirm (e.g., MTH2W, ENG2D/ENL2W, etc.). If you don’t know at build time, we can pass TBD and update later.

2) Build a Grade 10 file (example)
Math (Grade 10) — run after you upload the Word doc:

# Build Grade 10 Math map (update CODE and SOURCE_DESC if you know them)
scripts/oc_docx_to_map.sh \
  "source_docs/secondary/math/grade10_math_official.docx" \
  "curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade10_math.md" \
  "MTH2W" math 10 \
  "Ontario Curriculum — Grade 10 Mathematics (official Word, uploaded)"

# Quick verification
FILE="curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade10_math.md"
grep -n "^## Strand " "$FILE"
egrep -n "^([A-Z]{1,2}[0-9]|AA1)\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head -n 30

# Commit & push
git add "$FILE"
git commit -m "Stage 5: Grade 10 Math — populated from official Word source"
git push
English (Grade 10) — after uploading the Word doc:

scripts/oc_docx_to_map.sh \
  "source_docs/secondary/english/grade10_english_official.docx" \
  "curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade10_english.md" \
  "ENL2W" english 10 \
  "Ontario Curriculum — Grade 10 English (official Word, uploaded)"

FILE="curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade10_english.md"
grep -n "^## Strand " "$FILE"
egrep -n "^[ABCD][1-3]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head -n 30

git add "$FILE"
git commit -m "Stage 5: Grade 10 English — populated from official Word source"
git push
Repeat the same pattern for Grades 11 & 12 (math and English), adjusting file paths, course codes, subject, and grade.

3) Daily log entry (paste once per day)
LOG="project_logs/conversations/misc/$(date +%F)/$(date +%F)_progress.md"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$LOG")"
cat >> "$LOG" <<'MD'
# Stage 5 — Progress Log

- Imported official Word sources for secondary (10–12).
- Built/verified strand structure (codes normalized; no placeholders).
- Added planning tables and updated changelog in each file.
MD
git add "$LOG" && git commit -m "logs: Stage 5 daily snapshot ($(date +%F))" && git push
