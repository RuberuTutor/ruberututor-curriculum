Step 2 — Verify order + codes

egrep -n "^AA1\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" || true
egrep -n "^A[12]\.[0-9]+"  "$FILE" | head || true

egrep -n "^E1\.[0-9]+"     "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^F1\.[0-9]+"     "$FILE" | head || true
You should see headings in AA, A, B, C, D, E, F order and codes present for each.

Step 3 — Commit & push
RUN IN TERMINAL

git add "$FILE"
git commit -m "Stage 4: MTH1W — fix strand order to AA→A→B→C→D→E→F; verify codes"
git push
If any strand is missing codes in Step 2, paste the grep output here and I’ll give you a one-liner normalizer for that strand.

You’re super close—the file is correct but the strand order is still reversed (F→…→AA). Let’s fix the order and finalize. I’ll keep it one step at a time.

STEP 1 — Reorder strands to AA → A → B → C → D → E → F
RUN IN TERMINAL

FILE="$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md"
cp "$FILE" "${FILE%.md}.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).md"

awk 'BEGIN{ORS=""}
NR==1, /^# Expectations by Strand/ { header=header $0 "\n"; next }
{
  if ($0 ~ /^## Strand /) {
    if (cur) { sec[cur]=sec[cur] buf; buf="" }
    match($0,/^## Strand ([A-Z]{1,2})/,m); cur=m[1]
  }
  buf=buf $0 "\n"
}
END{
  if (cur) sec[cur]=sec[cur] buf
  print header
  if (sec["AA"]) print sec["AA"]
  if (sec["A"])  print sec["A"]
  if (sec["B"])  print sec["B"]
  if (sec["C"])  print sec["C"]
  if (sec["D"])  print sec["D"]
  if (sec["E"])  print sec["E"]
  if (sec["F"])  print sec["F"]
}' "$FILE" > "$FILE.tmp" && mv "$FILE.tmp" "$FILE"
STEP 2 — Verify order + codes
RUN IN TERMINAL

grep -n "^## Strand " "$FILE"
egrep -n "^AA1\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" || true
egrep -n "^A[12]\.[0-9]+"  "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^B[123]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^C[1-4]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^D[12]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^E1\.[0-9]+"     "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^F1\.[0-9]+"     "$FILE" | head || true
You should now see AA, A, B, C, D, E, F in that order, with codes present under each.

STEP 3 — Commit just the main file
You have a bunch of untracked backup files (that’s fine). Let’s only commit the canonical file.

RUN IN TERMINAL

git add "$FILE"
git commit -m "Stage 4: MTH1W — reorder strands to AA→A→B→C→D→E→F; verify codes"
git push
(Optional) STEP 4 — Clean up backup clutter or ignore it
If you want to keep backups but stop seeing them in git status, add a .gitignore rule.

RUN IN TERMINAL

printf "\n# Local backups\n*.bak.*\n*.tmp\n" >> "$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/.gitignore"
git add "$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/.gitignore"
git commit -m "chore: ignore local backup and tmp files"
git push
—or, if you want to move backups into your logs folder:

DEST="$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/project_logs/conversations/misc/2025-08-30/backups"
mkdir -p "$DEST"
mv "$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack"/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.bak.* "$DEST" 2>/dev/null || true
Reply with the grep -n "^## Strand " output if anything still looks off, and I’ll fix it in one command.

Got it — that awk error happened because the command you pasted had stray >>> / <<< characters. Let’s use a safe, macOS-compatible awk that doesn’t need fancy regex captures.

We’ll reorder to AA → A → B → C → D → E → F in three small steps.

1) Backup
RUN IN TERMINAL

cp "$FILE" "${FILE%.md}.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).md"
2) Reorder strands (robust BSD awk)
RUN IN TERMINAL

awk 'BEGIN{ORS=""; started=0}
{
  # Before the first "## Strand " line, accumulate header
  if (!started && $0 !~ /^## Strand /) { header = header $0 "\n"; next }

  # When we hit a strand heading, close the previous section (if any) and start a new one
  if ($0 ~ /^## Strand /) {
    started=1
    if (cur != "") { sec[cur]=sec[cur] buf; buf="" }

}' "$FILE" > "$FILE.tmp" && mv "$FILE.tmp" "$FILE"
3) Verify order + codes
RUN IN TERMINAL

grep -n "^## Strand " "$FILE"
egrep -n "^AA1\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" || true
egrep -n "^A[12]\.[0-9]+"  "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^B[123]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^C[1-4]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^D[12]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^E1\.[0-9]+"     "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^F1\.[0-9]+"     "$FILE" | head || true
You should now see headings listed in AA, A, B, C, D, E, F order and the codes present under each.

4) Commit just the main file
RUN IN TERMINAL

git add "$FILE"
git commit -m "Stage 4: MTH1W — reorder strands to AA→A→B→C→D→E→F; verify codes"
git push
If anything still looks off (order or missing codes), paste the grep -n "^## Strand " output and I’ll patch it with a tiny one-liner.
