👉 Once you see grade1_language.md in your folder, reply “Step 13 done”, and I’ll give you the official Grade 1 Language expectations to paste in next.

You said it would be easier going straight to github and dropbox
ChatGPT said:
Exactly 👍 — since GitHub and Dropbox are already connected, you don’t actually need to do all this in the terminal unless you want the command-line practice.

Here’s the easier way (especially for big copy-paste blocks like curriculum expectations):

📂 Option A — Dropbox (easiest for drafts)
Open your Dropbox folder in the web app (or Finder if synced locally).

Navigate to:
ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/

Click New File → choose Markdown (.md) or just create a text file and rename it grade1_language.md.

Paste in the template I gave you.

Save — Dropbox automatically syncs it across all your devices.

🐙 Option B — GitHub (easiest for version history & commits)
Go to your GitHub repo ruberututor_knowledge_pack.

Navigate to curriculum/ontario/maps/.

Click Add file → Create new file.

Name it grade1_language.md.

Paste in the template.

Scroll down → write a short commit message (e.g. “Add Grade 1 Language map template”).

Click Commit directly to main.

Now the file is live in GitHub with history, and you can pull/sync it locally anytime.

👉 The terminal way is great if you’re comfortable editing everything locally and pushing with git. But if your priority is just to get these curriculum maps written quickly, Dropbox or GitHub web is smoother.

Do you want me to switch our workflow to GitHub web commits (cleaner version tracking), or should we keep pushing step-by-step in terminal?
