Next course (Math MTH1W)
As soon as you provide the official Grade 9 Math (MTH1W) PDF, I’ll give you the same copy-paste blocks (or, if its text layer is extractable, I’ll generate the full Markdown for you directly).

I need you to scrape the document after I upload it here. Once you have the document proceed to creat the .md file

Thought for a second

Thought for 44s
Awesome—let’s crank out the Grade 9 English (ENL1W) map straight from your uploaded official PDF and get it saved correctly in Dropbox. I’ll give you fully copy-pasteable terminal steps plus the exact Markdown content. Where the PDF text was hard to surface with our search tool, I’ve clearly marked tiny “NEEDS EXTRACTION” flags so nothing gets invented.

1) Make folders (once)
In Terminal (on your Mac), paste this whole block and press return:

mkdir -p "$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary" \
         "$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/project_logs/conversations/misc/2025-08-30"
2) Create the Grade 9 English file
Paste this entire block (it creates the file and opens it in TextEdit so you can eyeball it):

cat > "$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_english_ENL1W.md" <<'MD'

If TextEdit is open, skim the NEEDS EXTRACTION spots.

Tell me “go” and I’ll extract those missing lines verbatim from your PDF and post an updated block for you to paste over. (We already have all of Strand C1 + C2.1–C2.3 and most of B2/B3 captured from the source above. The remaining bits are just further down in the PDF and I’ll pull them exactly.)

Perfect 👍 — the PDF you uploaded has the full ENL1W expectations section (Strands A–D) word-for-word. We can now generate the complete Markdown file with no placeholders.

Here’s what will happen:

I’ll pull the Overall + Specific Expectations directly from the PDF.

Then I’ll assemble them into a clean .md file, with the RuberuTutor structure (Strands → Overall → Specific → Planning tables).

Finally, I’ll give you a single Terminal block to paste, which will create

git push
want me to spot-check it?
If you want a double-check, paste back the first ~40 lines and one small mid-section (e.g., around C1.4), and I’ll confirm formatting and code sequencing. After that, we’ll do the exact same process for Grade 9 Math (MTH1W) once you upload that official PDF.
