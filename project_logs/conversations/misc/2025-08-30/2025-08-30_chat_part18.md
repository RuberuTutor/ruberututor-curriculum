Thought for a few seconds
You're in great shape. Two quick notes from that paste:

Those backslashes before $ and [ (like \$FILE, \[ ) mean the shell won’t expand variables or character classes. That’s why my commands always show plain $FILE and [0-9] without backslashes. In Terminal, paste them exactly as-is.

Now let’s tidy ENL1W to official order A → B → C → D, verify codes, and commit.

1) Set file + backup
FILE="$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_english_ENL1W.md"
cp "$FILE" "${FILE%.md}.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).md"
2) Reorder strands (macOS-safe awk)
This handles headings like ## Strand A. ... (note the dot). It strips the trailing . or : and re-assembles in A→B→C→D order.

awk 'BEGIN{ORS=""; started=0}
{
  if (!started && $0 !~ /^## Strand /) { header=header $0 "\n"; next }
  if ($0 ~ /^## Strand /) {
    started=1
    if (cur!="") { sec[cur]=sec[cur] buf; buf="" }
    code=$3; sub(/[.:]$/,"",code)   # turn "A." into "A"
    cur=code
  }
  if (started) { buf=buf $0 "\n" }
}
END{
  if (cur!="") { sec[cur]=sec[cur] buf }
  printf "%s", header
  if (sec["A"]) printf "%s", sec["A"]
  if (sec["B"]) printf "%s", sec["B"]
  if (sec["C"]) printf "%s", sec["C"]
  if (sec["D"]) printf "%s", sec["D"]
}' "$FILE" > "$FILE.tmp" && mv "$FILE.tmp" "$FILE"
3) Verify order + codes
grep -n "^## Strand " "$FILE"
egrep -n "^A[1-3]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^B[1-3]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^C[1-3]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head || true
egrep -n "^D[1-3]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head || true
You should see strands listed as A, B, C, D and codes under each.

4) Commit just ENL1W
git add "$FILE"
git commit -m "Stage 4: ENL1W — reorder strands to A→B→C→D; verify codes"
git push
(Optional) If you accidentally pasted backslashes into the file contents
If the markdown file itself has literal \[ or \$ you want to remove:

# remove backslashes preceding $ or [ within the file contents
sed -i '' -E 's/\\([$[])/\1/g' "$FILE"
git add "$FILE"
git commit -m "fix: remove stray backslashes from ENL1W"
git push
Paste the grep -n "^## Strand " output if anything looks off, and I’ll patch it.

Thought for 9s
awesome—your Grade 9 files look healthy and the codes are showing up exactly where we want them. let’s wrap Grade 9 with a tidy “finish” pass and lock it in.

Step 1 — Add planning tables to both Grade 9 files
Paste each block exactly as-is.

1A) Add to MTH1W
FILE="$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md"

cat >> "$FILE" <<'MD'
