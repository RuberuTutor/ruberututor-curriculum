egrep -n "^[ABCD][1-3]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head -n 30
Step 3 — Clean the stray typo folder and temp files (safe)
# remove the mistaken "curriculum/ontari" folder if it exists
rm -rf "$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontari"

# ensure local .gitignore covers backups/tmp (already added, but just in case)
printf "\n# Local backups\n*.bak.*\n*.tmp\n" >> "$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/.gitignore"
Step 4 — Commit & push the planning tables + cleanup
git add "$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/.gitignore" \
        "$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md" \

git commit -m "Stage 4: add planning tables to Grade 9 English (ENL1W) and Math (MTH1W); cleanup"
git push
Step 5 — Log the decision

When you’ve run these, paste back the two grep -n "^## Strand " outputs (for ENL1W and MTH1W) so I can give a last thumbs-up and we’ll move on to the next files.

beautiful—Grade 9 Math (MTH1W) and English (ENL1W) are now fully structured, codes validate, planning tables added, and everything’s pushed. Let’s “lock” this snapshot and prep the workspace for materials.

Step 6 — Create a release tag for this snapshot
cd ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack
git tag -a v2025-08-30-stage4 -m "Grade 9 ENL1W + MTH1W complete; planning tables added; cleanup"
git push origin v2025-08-30-stage4
Step 7 — Create folders that match the planning tables
# Math Grade 9
mkdir -p materials/worksheets/math/grade9
mkdir -p materials/assessments/math/grade9

# English Grade 9
mkdir -p materials/worksheets/english/grade9
mkdir -p materials/assessments/english/grade9

git add materials/worksheets/{math,english}/grade9 materials/assessments/{math,english}/grade9
git commit -m "chore: scaffold Grade 9 worksheets/assessments directories"
git push
Step 8 — Quick final validators (just to keep handy)
# MTH1W: strand order + a few code samples
FILE=~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md
grep -n "^## Strand " "$FILE"
egrep -n "^(AA1|A[12]|B[123]|C[1-4]|D[12]|E1|F1)\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head -n 20

# ENL1W: strand order + a few code samples
FILE=~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_english_ENL1W.md
grep -n "^## Strand " "$FILE"
egrep -n "^[ABCD][1-3]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head -n 20
Step 9 — (Optional) housekeeping: prune local backups older than today
# harmless: only removes .bak.* files older than 1 day inside the repo
find ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack -type f -name "*.bak.*" -mtime +1 -print -delete
If you run those three steps, you’re 100% staged for building the actual worksheet/assessment files (vA–vD) next. Want me to generate the first worksheet set (e.g., MTH1W → Strand B → B2 exponents) right away?

This chat is way to slow. I need to start a new chat, but I want you to give me a primer and also instruct the chat to review all previous chat backups from 08/30/2025 and 08/29/2025

Perfect — let’s build you a Stage 4 Primer for the new chat.
You’ll paste this right at the start of the new session, and it will automatically “remind” the model to pull from your 08-29 and 08-30 backups.

📌 Primer for New Chat — Stage 4 (Secondary Curriculum Mapping)
This chat is part of the RuberuTutor Curriculum Project — Stage 4 (Secondary Curriculum Mapping, Grades 9–12).

👉 Important: Please review all previous chat backups stored in my repo under:

project_logs/conversations/misc/2025-08-29/

project_logs/conversations/misc/2025-08-30/

These contain full transcripts and progress logs. Use them as authoritative context when continuing this work.

Repo Layout
Conversations & logs:

project_logs/conversations/misc/YYYY-MM-DD/

project_logs/conversations/assessments/gradeX/YYYY-MM-DD/

Worksheets: materials/worksheets/{math,english}/gradeX/ (gr1–gr12, vA–vD)

Assessments: materials/assessments/{math,english}/gradeX/ (gr1–gr12, vA–vD)

Curriculum references: curriculum/ontario/ (PDFs, Word snapshots, changelogs)

Maps: curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/ (final .md curriculum maps by grade/course)

Stage 4 Goals
Build clean .md curriculum maps for Grades 9–12 Math & English, one course at a time.

Use official Ontario curriculum PDFs/Word docs only (verbatim expectations).

Maintain consistent .md structure:

Strands (AA–F for Math; A–D for English)

Overall expectations

Specific expectations (codes: e.g., B2.1, C1.4, etc.)

Planning tables (worksheets + assessments, vA–vD)

Changelog

Archive in curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/ and log progress in
project_logs/conversations/misc/YYYY-MM-DD/.

✅ Action for this chat: Continue Stage 4, starting from where we left off on 2025-08-30. Reference all backups from 08-29 and 08-30 to preserve continuity.

Would you like me to also draft you a short “nano-ready” command block that you can paste into terminal to automatically copy this primer into your clipboard before opening the new chat?
