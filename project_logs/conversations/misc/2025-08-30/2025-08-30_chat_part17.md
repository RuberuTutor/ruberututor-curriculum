Boom — that did it. Your MTH1W file is now ordered AA → A → B → C → D → E → F, codes look good, and it’s pushed. ✅

If you want a quick victory lap:

FILE="$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md"
grep -n "^## Strand " "$FILE"
egrep -n "^(AA1|A[12]|B[123]|C[1-4]|D[12]|E1|F1)\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head -n 40
Next best steps (your pick)
Finish Grade 9 English (ENL1W): verify strand order A→D, add planning tables, and push.

FILE="$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_english_ENL1W.md"
grep -n "^## Strand " "$FILE"
If you want, I’ll give you the same strand-by-strand paste blocks for ENL1W.

Snapshot today’s progress in your project log:

LOG="$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/project_logs/conversations/misc/2025-08-30/2025-08-30_progress.md"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$LOG")"
cat <<'MD' >> "$LOG"
## Stage 4 — 2025-08-30
- Grade 9 Math (MTH1W): AA–F expectations inserted verbatim; strand order normalized; placeholders removed; planning/changelog added.
- Backups ignored via .gitignore; repo clean.
MD
git add "$LOG"
git commit -m "logs: Stage 4 progress snapshot (2025-08-30)"
git push
Lock structure for Grades 10–12 (placeholders only, to avoid confusion later):

Rock solid progress. ✅ Math 9 is clean, ordered, and pushed; placeholders for 10–12 are in. Let’s tidy Grade 9 English (ENL1W) so its strands are in the official order A → B → C → D, then commit.

Step 1 — Backup ENL1W
FILE="$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_english_ENL1W.md"
cp "$FILE" "${FILE%.md}.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).md"
Step 2 — Reorder strands to A→B→C→D (macOS-safe awk)
awk 'BEGIN{ORS=""; started=0}
{
  # collect header before first "## Strand "
  if (!started && $0 !~ /^## Strand /) { header=header $0 "\n"; next }

  # when a strand starts, close previous and start new
  if ($0 ~ /^## Strand /) {
    started=1
    if (cur!="") { sec[cur]=sec[cur] buf; buf="" }
    code=$3                    # e.g., "A." / "B."
    sub(/[.:]$/,"",code)       # strip trailing "." or ":"
    cur=code
  }
  if (started) { buf=buf $0 "\n" }
}
END{
  if (cur!="") { sec[cur]=sec[cur] buf }
  printf "%s", header
  if (sec["A"]) printf "%s", sec["A"]
  if (sec["B"]) printf "%s", sec["B"]
  if (sec["C"]) printf "%s", sec["C"]
  if (sec["D"]) printf "%s", sec["D"]
}' "$FILE" > "$FILE.tmp" && mv "$FILE.tmp" "$FILE"
Step 3 — Verify order + codes exist
