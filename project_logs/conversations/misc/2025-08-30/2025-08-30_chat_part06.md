7) Final sanity checks
# Strand headings present?
grep -n "^## Strand " "$FILE"

# Expectation codes present?
egrep -n "^[ABCD][1-3]\." "$FILE" | head -n 20

# Spot-check around C1.4 and D2.1 if they exist in your copy

8) Open to review, then commit & push
open -e "$FILE"

git add "$FILE"
git commit -m "Stage 4: Grade 9 English (ENL1W) — expectations copied verbatim from official PDF"
git push
If anything looks off
If a paste brings in weird line breaks, repeat the copy (PDF) → paste (pbpaste) step for that strand; it’s safe to run again because each step appends.

If you accidentally duplicated a strand, we can trim lines with sed — tell me which line numbers grep -n shows and I’ll give you a one-liner to clean it.

When you’re done with ENL1W, I’ll give you the exact same clipboard workflow for Grade 9 Math (MTH1W) as soon as you upload that official PDF.

Thought for 6s
Thanks for the heads up — that file you opened with the :contentReference[...] lines was from an earlier scaffold. We’re replacing it now with verbatim text from your official PDF in small, nano-friendly chunks.

I’ve extracted the expectations from your uploaded ENL1W PDF and prepared 4 paste blocks (A, B, C, D). Follow these steps exactly:

Step 0 — open the target file
nano ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_english_ENL1W.md
When nano opens, use the arrow keys to go to Strand A. Delete any placeholder/instructional lines, so your cursor is on a blank line where Strand A should start.

Step 1 — paste Strand A (verbatim)
Paste this entire block into nano:

## Strand A. Literacy Connections and Applications

In this strand, students strengthen their understanding of how language and literacy are connected to identity and contribute to community. They examine how their lived experiences and identities and those of others are rooted in families, communities, groups, and nations. They develop this knowledge by engaging with a diversity of texts and by reading, listening to, viewing, and creating texts for a variety of purposes and audiences. They use transferable skills when reading, listening to, viewing, and creating texts of various forms. They also use digital and media tools and strategies to research, construct knowledge, demonstrate their learning, and collaborate. Students learn to interact safely and responsibly in online environments. They develop the knowledge and skills needed to be critical consumers and creators of media and to communicate and collaborate with others in inclusive, respectful, and responsible ways.

**Overall expectations**
