How I’ll run this (tomorrow)
I’ll work course by course in this exact sequence: G10 Math → G10 English → G11 Math → G11 English → G12 Math → G12 English.

For each: run the build script, verify strands & codes, commit, push, and log.

If a document is missing or the course code isn’t explicit, I’ll stop and tell you exactly which Word file I need (by subject, grade, and exact Ministry title).

When you open the new chat titled “5th Stage – Secondary Curriculum Mapping”, paste your primer + checklist, upload the first two Word files (G10 Math & English), and we’ll start immediately with those build commands.
