ChatGPT said:
Ah — I see what happened 👀.

You accidentally pasted Markdown directly into the shell prompt (bash). That’s why it’s saying things like -bash: AA1.: command not found. The terminal is trying to execute the lines instead of writing them into your .md file.

✅ How to fix
Instead of pasting Markdown into the shell, you need to open the file in an editor or use a cat <<'MD' >> file.md block to capture the Markdown properly.

Option 1 — Use nano (simplest)
nano ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md
Scroll to the bottom (or wherever you want Strand AA).

Paste the Markdown block I gave you.

Save with Ctrl+O, press Enter, then exit with Ctrl+X.

Option 2 — Use cat <<'MD' block (good for copy-paste)
cat <<'MD' >> ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md
## Strand AA: Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) Skills in Mathematics

### Overall Expectation
AA1. Social-Emotional Learning Skills  
Develop and explore a variety of social-emotional learning skills in a context that supports and reflects this learning in connection with the expectations across all other strands.  
*(Note: This overall expectation is to be included in classroom instruction, but not in assessment, evaluation, or reporting.)*

### Specific Expectations

- **AA1.2** use social-awareness and relationship skills to work respectfully and collaboratively in teams, recognizing and celebrating each other’s strengths and learning from one another

MD
That cat <<'MD' ... MD trick tells bash: “Don’t execute this — just write everything between MD … MD into the file.”

👉 Which way do you prefer? I can reformat all of Strand B–F into cat <<'MD' blocks so you can just paste once per strand, instead of juggling nano. Would you like me to do that?

You said:
I am just entering whatever you give me , copy and paste. I just saved the above in nano
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ✅ — saving the Strand AA block in nano is exactly right. That’s the safe way: paste the Markdown inside nano, save, and exit.

Now we’ll continue the same way for the other strands. Since you’re just copy-pasting, I’ll reformat each Strand into nano-ready blocks — you open your file in nano, scroll to the end, and paste the whole block. No shell confusion this time.
