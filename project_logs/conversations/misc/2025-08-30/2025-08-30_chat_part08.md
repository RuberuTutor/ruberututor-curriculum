Great push! Your English file is clean, and Grade 9 Math has Strand AA in place. Let’s keep going with Grade 9 Math (MTH1W) in the safest, copy-exactly way—using your clipboard so the wording comes straight from the official PDF you uploaded.

We’ll paste one strand at a time (nano-friendly). You’ll do the same 3 steps for each strand: copy from the PDF → run the little paste block → verify.

Before you start (one-time)
FILE="$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$FILE")"

# If the file is empty or only has Strand AA, add a header once:
if ! grep -q "^# Expectations by Strand" "$FILE" 2>/dev/null; then
  cat <<'MD' > "$FILE"

# Expectations by Strand
MD
fi
✅ Strand A — Mathematical Thinking and Making Connections
Open your Mathematics (2021) PDF.

Find “Strand A: Mathematical Thinking and Making Connections”.

Select from Overall Expectation(s) through all Specific Expectations in Strand A (A1… and A2… blocks).

Don’t include the “Strand A” heading itself in the selection—start right at “Overall Expectation(s)”.

Press ⌘C (copy).

Paste into the file with:

printf "\n## Strand A: Mathematical Thinking and Making Connections\n\n" >> "$FILE"
pbpaste >> "$FILE"
printf "\n\n---\n" >> "$FILE"
Verify:

grep -n "## Strand A" "$FILE"
egrep -n "^[A][12]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head
✅ Strand B — Number
In the PDF, go to “Strand B: Number”.

Select Overall Expectation(s) through all B1./B2./B3. Specific Expectations.

⌘C copy.

Paste:

printf "\n## Strand B: Number\n\n" >> "$FILE"
pbpaste >> "$FILE"
printf "\n\n---\n" >> "$FILE"
Verify:

grep -n "## Strand B" "$FILE"
egrep -n "^B[123]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head
✅ Strand C — Algebra
In the PDF, go to “Strand C: Algebra”.

Select Overall + all Specifics (C1… C2… C3… C4…).

Copy, then:

printf "\n## Strand C: Algebra\n\n" >> "$FILE"
pbpaste >> "$FILE"
printf "\n\n---\n" >> "$FILE"
Verify:

grep -n "## Strand C" "$FILE"
egrep -n "^C[1-4]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head
✅ Strand D — Data
# Copy from PDF: Strand D Overall + D1./D2. specifics → to clipboard
printf "\n## Strand D: Data\n\n" >> "$FILE"
pbpaste >> "$FILE"
printf "\n\n---\n" >> "$FILE"

grep -n "## Strand D" "$FILE"
egrep -n "^D[12]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head
✅ Strand E — Geometry and Measurement
# Copy from PDF: Strand E Overall + E1.x specifics → to clipboard
printf "\n## Strand E: Geometry and Measurement\n\n" >> "$FILE"
pbpaste >> "$FILE"
printf "\n\n---\n" >> "$FILE"

grep -n "## Strand E" "$FILE"
egrep -n "^E1\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head
✅ Strand F — Financial Literacy
# Copy from PDF: Strand F Overall + F1.x specifics → to clipboard
printf "\n## Strand F: Financial Literacy\n\n" >> "$FILE"
pbpaste >> "$FILE"
printf "\n\n---\n" >> "$FILE"

grep -n "## Strand F" "$FILE"
egrep -n "^F1\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head
(Optional) Normalize codes for easy grepping
If the PDF paste brought in bold around the codes (e.g., **B1.1**), run this once:

# Strip leading bold around codes at start of a line
sed -i '' -E 's/^\*\*([ABCDEF][0-9]\.[0-9]+)\*\*/\1/' "$FILE"
Then re-check:

egrep -n "^[ABCDEF][0-9]\.[0-9]+" "$FILE" | head -n 30
Add planning + changelog (one-time)
cat <<'MD' >> "$FILE"

# Planning

## Worksheets (vA–vD)
| Unit | Strand | Expectations | Variant(s) | Path |

git commit -m "Stage 4: Grade 9 Math (MTH1W) — expectations copied verbatim from official PDF"
git push
What I can do next
If you hit any snag (weird line breaks, an extra header got copied), paste the last 20–40 lines here and I’ll give you a one-liner to fix them.
When Math is done, I can give you the same clipboard workflow to scaffold Grades 10–12 or jump to Grades 2–8 for elementary mapping—your call.

✅ Excellent — both Grade 9 English (ENL1W) and Grade 9 Math (MTH1W) are now committed and backed up in GitHub with verbatim expectations from the official PDFs.

Here’s where you stand:

ENL1W (English): Clean file, deduplicated, codes normalized, complete.

MTH1W (Math): Header + Strands A–F + SEL (AA) all in place, planning tables added, committed.

Sanity check for codes didn’t print because the codes are likely still bolded (e.g., **B1.1**). That’s harmless for GitHub display, but if you want grepping to work, we can strip the ** around the expectation codes with a single sed line later.

✅ Next Options
Normalize Math codes so your grep checks (like egrep "^B1.") will return results. (Takes 1 one-liner.)

Proceed to Grade 10 scaffolding (Math + English placeholders).

Return to Elementary (Grades 2–8) if you want to keep momentum building those .md files.

👉 Do you want me to run the one-liner cleanup on Math to normalize the codes now, or should we move straight to scaffolding Grade 10 Math + English?

ChatGPT said:
Perfect 🚀 — we’ll lock in a full sweep so Stage 4 is airtight.
Here’s the sequence we’ll cover:

✅ Part 1 — Normalize codes (ENL1W + MTH1W)
Strip the ** so grep/filters work cleanly.

# English
sed -i '' -E 's/^\*\*([ABCD][1-3]\.[0-9]+)\*\*/\1/' \
  ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_english_ENL1W.md

# Math
sed -i '' -E 's/^\*\*([ABCDEF][0-9]\.[0-9]+)\*\*/\1/' \
  ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md
sed -i '' -E 's/^\*\*(AA1\.[0-9]+)\*\*/\1/' \
  ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md

# Verify
egrep -n "^[ABCD][1-3]\." ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_english_ENL1W.md | head -n 20
egrep -n "^[ABCDEF][0-9]\." ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md | head -n 20
egrep -n "^AA1\." ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md
✅ Part 2 — Scaffold Grade 10–12 placeholders
cd ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary

# Grade 10
cat <<'MD' > grade10_english.md
# Grade 10 English — Ontario Curriculum
⚠️ Placeholder. Use official 2007 curriculum until update.

cat <<'MD' > grade12_math.md
# Grade 12 Mathematics — Ontario Curriculum
⚠️ Placeholder. Use official 2007 curriculum.
MD
✅ Part 3 — Quick verification
ls -1 ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary
You should now see:

grade9_english_ENL1W.md
grade9_math_MTH1W.md
grade10_english.md
grade10_math.md
grade11_english.md
grade11_math.md
grade12_english.md
grade12_math.md
✅ Part 4 — Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Stage 4: Normalize codes for ENL1W/MTH1W + scaffold Grade 10–12 placeholders"
git push
📌 Next Moves
Once all of that’s done:

We’ll have Grades 9–12 all scaffolded in secondary.

Both Grade 9 Math + English fully populated and normalized.

Placeholders ready for 10–12, so you won’t get missing file errors.

👉 Do you want me to immediately prep the clipboard workflow for filling Grade 10 English (ENG2D) and Grade 10 Math expectations from the 2007/2005 PDFs, or should we swing back and finish Grades 2–8 elementary mapping first?

Thought for 9s
boom—secondary is scaffolded cleanly (I see the 9–12 files + your ENL1W backup). Here’s the tight game plan to finish Grade 9 perfectly and set up Grades 2–8 next.

1) Grade 9 — quick cleanups & checks
A) Normalize code lines (makes grepping work)
# English: remove bold at the start of expectation lines (A/B/C/D)
sed -i '' -E 's/^\*\*([ABCD][1-3]\.[0-9]+)\*\*/\1/' \
  ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_english_ENL1W.md

# Math: remove bold for A–F codes and AA codes at start of line
sed -i '' -E 's/^\*\*([ABCDEF][0-9]\.[0-9]+)\*\*/\1/' \
  ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md
sed -i '' -E 's/^\*\*(AA1\.[0-9]+)\*\*/\1/' \
  ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md
B) Verify codes render
egrep -n "^[ABCD][1-3]\.[0-9]+" ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_english_ENL1W.md | head -n 20
egrep -n "^[ABCDEF][0-9]\.[0-9]+" ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md | head -n 20
egrep -n "^AA1\.[0-9]+" ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md
If a grep returns nothing for a strand, it just means that strand’s content was pasted as paragraphs without the code starting the line—ping me and I’ll give you a tiny one-liner to fix that formatting.

C) Commit the cleanup
git add ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_english_ENL1W.md \
        ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md
git commit -m "Stage 4: normalize expectation code lines for ENL1W & MTH1W"
git push
2) (If needed) Finish Grade 9 Math strands via clipboard
If any of Strands A–F in grade9_math_MTH1W.md are still placeholders, use the same clipboard steps we used earlier:

Open the PDF to that strand → select Overall + all Specific expectations → ⌘C → run:

FILE="$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/curriculum/ontario/maps/secondary/grade9_math_MTH1W.md"
printf "\n## Strand X: <exact title from PDF>\n\n" >> "$FILE"
pbpaste >> "$FILE"
printf "\n\n---\n" >> "$FILE"
Replace X and the title with the actual strand, e.g. “Strand C: Algebra”. Then re-run the grep checks above.

3) Log today’s progress (nice paper trail)
LOG="$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/project_logs/conversations/misc/2025-08-30/2025-08-30_progress.md"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$LOG")"
cat <<'MD' >> "$LOG"
## Stage 4 – 2025-08-30
- Grade 9 ENL1W finalized; duplicates removed; expectation code lines normalized.
- Grade 9 MTH1W: Strand AA added; Strands A–F scaffolded; planning & changelog added; codes normalized.
- Secondary placeholders: Grades 10–12 English/Math created for later population.
MD
open -a TextEdit "$LOG"
4) Next major move — Grades 2–8 population (your Stage 4 goal)
To fill Grades 2–8 (Math + Language) accurately, I need the two official elementary PDFs:

Mathematics (2020) — The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 1–8: Mathematics (2020)

Language (2023) — The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 1–8: Language (2023)

👉 Please upload those two PDFs here.
Once they’re in, I’ll give you the same nano-friendly strand-by-strand paste blocks (A–F for Math; A–D for Language) and we’ll populate Grades 2–8 fast and perfectly, matching your required Markdown structure and expectation codes.

If you’d rather I jump to Grade 10 English/Math first (using the 2007/2005 docs), say the word and I’ll switch tracks—but Stage 4’s target is Grades 2–8, so I recommend we do those next.
