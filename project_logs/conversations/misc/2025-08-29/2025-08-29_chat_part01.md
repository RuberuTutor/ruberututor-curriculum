RuberuTutor Worksheets Dev (Gr1-12)
ChatGPT said:
Got it — sounds like you want to spin up a RuberuTutor Worksheets Dev (Grades 1–12) workspace.

To clarify, do you want me to:

Create a structured worksheet development framework (organized by grade levels and subjects, with templates)?

Generate starter worksheet sets (e.g., Math, English, Science) for specific grades?

Or set up a development tracker/log similar to what we did for curriculum mapping, so each worksheet batch has versioned progress notes in your repo?

I can scaffold this so you’ll have:

📂 A folder structure (Gr1, Gr2, … Gr12)

📑 Standardized worksheet templates (with sections like Learning Goal, Examples, Practice, Challenge)

📝 A dev log (project_logs/worksheets) that auto-records changes and new worksheet pushes

👉 Which direction do you want to start with — framework setup, worksheet generation, or tracker setup?

This continues from my RuberuTutor project. 
I already have a repo with worksheets, assessments, backups, and saver scripts. 
Pick up where we left off.

Ruberu Tutor Worksheets Dev — Kickoff Pack (gr1–12)

RuberuTutor Worksheets Dev — Kickoff Pack (Gr1–12)
This continues from the RuberuTutor repo with existing worksheets, assessments, backups, and saver scripts. Below is a concrete, drop‑in expansion: folder conventions, a universal worksheet template, metadata schema, a generator script, and a Grade 7 starter set wired to your recent curriculum mapping.

1) Repository Additions & Conventions
Proposed folders (non‑destructive; add only if missing):

/worksheets
  /gr01 /gr02 ... /gr12
    /math /english /science /social
      /units
        /wksh_YYYYMMDD_slug
          worksheet.md
          answer_key.md
          assets/ (images, charts)
          meta.yaml
/project_logs/worksheets
/scripts
  make_worksheet.py
/docs
  worksheets_style_guide.md
File naming

Worksheets live in date‑stamped subfolders: wksh_YYYYMMDD_slug (e.g., wksh_20250828_integer-operations).

Answer keys mirror worksheet titles with _key or separate answer_key.md.

Keep assets local to the worksheet directory for portability.

Git hygiene

One worksheet per commit; message: add(gr7/math): integer operations — worksheet + key.

Auto‑log to project_logs/worksheets (see §4).

2) Universal Worksheet Template (Markdown)
Save as: /worksheets/_TEMPLATE.md

# Integer Operations

## Learning Goals
- I can add and subtract integers using a number line.
- I can multiply and divide integers and explain why the signs work the way they do.

## Warm‑up (5 min)
1. Plot −3 and +4 on a number line.
2. What is the opposite of −7? What is the absolute value of −7?

## Worked Examples (teacher‑led)
**Example A (Addition)**
- Prompt: −5 + 8
- Solution steps: start at −5 → move 8 to the right → **+3**

**Example B (Multiplication)**
- Prompt: (−6) × (−2)
- Solution steps: two negatives make a positive → **+12**

2 worked examples, then 3 guided items that mirror the examples.

4–6 independent items; 1 extension.

Consistent typography: use ## for section heads.

Answer key mirrors order and numbering.

8) Suggested Next Commits
Add _TEMPLATE.md, make_worksheet.py, style guide, and Gr7 seed.

Run generator to seed Gr3 English and Gr10 Science examples.

Push and log:

git add worksheets/_TEMPLATE.md scripts/make_worksheet.py docs/worksheets_style_guide.md \
        worksheets/gr7/math/units/wksh_20250828_integer-operations/
git commit -m "add(gr7/math): Integer Operations worksheet + key + template + generator"
git push origin main

# Log the work
printf "✅ Seeded Gr7 Integer Operations — $(date +%F)\n" >> project_logs/worksheets/CHANGELOG.md
Done. Ready for you to paste into the repo.
If you want, I can generate the Gr3 English and Gr10 Science seeds next in the same format.

Awesome — I picked up from your RuberuTutor repo setup and dropped a ready-to-commit Worksheets Dev Kickoff Pack into the canvas:

Clean folder conventions (non-destructive).

A universal worksheet template + YAML schema.

A Python generator script to spin up new worksheet skeletons.

A Grade 7 Math: Integer Operations seed (worksheet, answer key, meta), aligned with your recent mapping.

A lightweight style guide and a dev roadmap log.

If you want, I can immediately generate the Gr3 English (Main Idea & Details) and Gr10 Science (Stoichiometry Basics) seeds next.

I need help backing up the other chat to github. I have the same terminal screen open but I'm following directions without positive results
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 16s
No stress — let’s get that other chat into GitHub. Here’s a quick, copy-paste friendly path that works on macOS Terminal.

A) Fastest path: paste the chat into a log file, commit, push
Make sure you’re in the repo:

pwd
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
(Second line should print your repo root. If it errors, cd into your repo folder first.)

Copy the entire “other chat” (Cmd+A, Cmd+C) in your browser, then run:

# Make a dated log file from your clipboard
mkdir -p project_logs/conversations/misc
F="project_logs/conversations/misc/$(date +%F)_other-chat.md"
pbpaste > "$F"
echo "✅ Saved chat to $F"
Commit & push:

git status
git add "$F"
git commit -m "log(chat): $(basename "$F" .md) — backup conversation"
git pull --rebase  # just in case main moved
git push origin main
You’re done. Check the file on GitHub.

B) If push fails, use this quick triage
1) “rejected (non-fast-forward)”
Your local is behind. Bring it up to date, then re-push:

git pull --rebase
git push origin main
2) Merge conflicts after pull
Open the files listed, fix <<<<<<< >>>>>>> sections, then:

git add <fixed-files>
git rebase --continue
git push origin main
3) “not a git repository”
You’re not in the repo folder:

cd /path/to/your/repo
4) “Authentication failed / PAT required”
You may need to sign in again:

git remote -v  # confirm the origin URL
# If needed, switch to HTTPS and re-enter credentials
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<USER>/<REPO>.git
(When prompted, use your GitHub username and a Personal Access Token as the password.)

5) “fatal: You are not currently on a branch (detached HEAD)”
Create a branch, push, then (optionally) merge on GitHub:

git switch -c backup/chat-log-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git push -u origin HEAD
6) “file is too large”
Either remove it from the commit or use Git LFS:

git reset HEAD~   # undo last commit but keep changes staged
# or track large types
git lfs install
