Primer message reference → you’re right, I didn’t mention worksheets in it yet.
We should add:

- **Worksheets** are in `materials/worksheets/` (math & english, gr1–gr12, with vA–vD variants).
- **Assessment papers** are in `materials/assessments/`.
That way every new chat will know where to look for worksheets as well.

Student-facing linkage → later, when a student is placed via an assessment, we’ll want to directly reference the exact worksheet path (e.g., materials/worksheets/math/gr10/B_Number/Gr10_Math_B_Number_B1-1_MultiplicationWithin50_vA.pdf).

✅ So yes: you already have the folders in GitHub and Dropbox for worksheets.
We just need to update the primer message to include them.

👉 Do you want me to rewrite the PROJECT_README.md primer now to include worksheets + assessments so all new chats are 100% in sync?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 — let’s update your PROJECT_README.md so every new chat knows about:

Notes (misc + assessment logs)

Worksheets (math/english by grade, with variants)

Assessments (papers/tests per grade)

Curriculum (Ontario knowledge base)

📌 Updated Primer (for PROJECT_README.md)
# RuberuTutor Curriculum Project — Chat Primer

When starting a new ChatGPT session for this project, paste the following message at the beginning:

---

This chat is part of the **RuberuTutor Curriculum Project**.  
Please reference my previous transcripts and setup notes, which are stored in my repo under:  

project_logs/conversations/misc/YYYY-MM-DD/
project_logs/conversations/assessments/gradeX/YYYY-MM-DD/


- **General notes** are in `misc/`.  
- **Assessment work logs** are in `assessments/grade1–grade12/`.  
- **Worksheets** are in `materials/worksheets/` (math & english, gr1–gr12, each with vA–vD variants).  
- **Assessment papers** are in `materials/assessments/` (math & english, gr1–gr12, each with vA–vD variants).  
- **Curriculum references** are in `curriculum/ontario/` (source docs, snapshots, change logs).  

Use those logs and folders for context when I ask about prior decisions (assessment structure, Kumon-style worksheet design, backup routines, curriculum mappings, etc.).  

---

Always begin with this primer when creating a new ChatGPT conversation tied to the RuberuTutor project.
✅ Next Step in Terminal
Replace the old README with this updated one:

cd ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack

cat > PROJECT_README.md <<'MD'

MD

git add PROJECT_README.md
git commit -m "docs: update primer to include worksheets and assessments"
git push
👉 Do you want me to also add a very short command (like showprimer) so you can instantly display this text in your terminal whenever you need to copy it into a new chat?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Great 👍 Let’s add a tiny helper so you can always run showprimer in your terminal and instantly copy the Chat Primer text.

Step 1 — Add script
Run this in Terminal:

cd ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack

cat > tools/show_primer.sh <<'SH'
#!/bin/bash
# Print the RuberuTutor Chat Primer (from PROJECT_README.md)

PRIMER_FILE="$HOME/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/PROJECT_README.md"

if [[ -f "$PRIMER_FILE" ]]; then
  cat "$PRIMER_FILE"
else
  echo "❌ PROJECT_README.md not found at $PRIMER_FILE"
fi
SH

chmod +x tools/show_primer.sh
git add tools/show_primer.sh
git commit -m "chore: add show_primer.sh to display PROJECT_README.md easily"
git push
Step 2 — Add shell alias
So you don’t have to type the full path, add an alias:

echo 'alias showprimer="bash ~/Dropbox/ruberututor_knowledge_pack/tools/show_primer.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
Step 3 — Usage
Now you can just run:

showprimer
👉 It will print the Chat Primer directly in your terminal, ready to copy-paste into a new ChatGPT conversation.

Do you also want me to make a variant that copies the primer straight into your clipboard (so you don’t even have to select it, just ⌘V into ChatGPT)?

You said:
backupchat
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ✅ — here’s what will happen when you run backupchat now:

Terminal will pause with:
👉 COPY the entire chat now (⌘A, ⌘C). When ready, press ENTER here…

You flip back here, press ⌘A, ⌘C to copy this whole chat.

Return to Terminal, press Enter.

The script will:

Save a full transcript and split parts (~400 lines each).

Store them under:

project_logs/conversations/misc/YYYY-MM-DD/
Commit and push to GitHub + Dropbox.

Confirm with a ✅ message.

👉 Go ahead and run backupchat in your Terminal now.
Once it finishes, do you want me to give you a quick one-liner check so you can instantly verify the files landed on GitHub?
